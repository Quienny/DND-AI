  "content": "Nezznar\u2019s exploration of Wave Echo Cave has yielded some treasure, which the drow keeps in the sack on the wooden table. The sack contains 190 ep, 130 gp, 15 pp, nine small gemstones (10 gp each), and a dwarven ale mug made of hammered electrum (100 gp).\n\nAwarding Experience Points\n\nIf Nezznar is captured alive and delivered to Sildar Hallwinter or Townmaster Wester in Phandalin, award the party double his XP value.\n\n20. Priests\u2019 Quarters\n\nThe door to this room is locked, requiring thieves\u2019 tools and a successful DC 15 Dexterity check to open. Nezznar (area 19) carries the key.\n\nUnless the characters are being stealthy, any activity at the door attracts the attention of Nezznar and his allies in area 19, prompting the drow to send his giant spiders to investigate.\n\nbludgeoning damage from falling rubble and falling prone on a failure, or taking only half the damage on a success.\n\nTable . The table is strewn with notes and maps showing Nezznar\u2019s efforts at exploring the mine so far. A black leather sack of treasure is amid the papers (see the \u201cTreasure\u201d section).\n\nRoleplaying Nezznar\n\nEven though he intends to kill the characters, Nezznar is curious about them. Given the chance, he quizzes the characters at length regarding their identities, allegiances, interests, and goals,. He files it all away in memory in the hope that someday he might find a use for what he learns.\n\nNezznar admits to being the Black Spider, and to using the Cragmaw goblins and the Redbrands to ensure that Wave Echo Cave remains his secret. He will say or do anything to put the characters off their guard, including promising to surrender or proposing cooperation against the monsters impeding his progress toward reaching the Forge of Spells. However, he betrays the characters as soon as they outlive their usefulness.\n\nDusty draperies adorn the walls of this room, which also contains a bed and brazier. A badly disheveled dwarf lies bound and unconscious on the cold stone floor.\n\nThis room formerly belonged to the priest in charge of Dumathoin\u2019s temple (area 19), but Nezznar has appropriated it for use as a cell. The figure lying on the floor is Nundro, a dwarf commoner and the youngest of the three Rockseeker brothers. Nezznar spared him because he thought the dwarf might know more about the mine than he admitted. The drow has interrogated Nundro harshly once or twice a day ever since capturing him.\n\nDevelopments\n\nNundro is grateful if the adventurers rescue him, and he offers to tag along for the duration of their stay in Wave Echo Cave. Nundro doesn\u2019t know any more about the layout than the characters, so he hasn\u2019t much to offer in the way of useful information. See the \u201cNPC Party Members\u201d sidebar (page 1 1) for tips on running Nundro.\n\n50\n\nPART 4: WAVE ECHO CAVE\n\nIf the characters deal with Nezznar and his minions, this area serves as a safe and comfortable place to rest before continuing their explorations of the mine.\n\nAwarding Experience Points\n\nIf Nundro is rescued and survives the adventure, divide\n\n200 XP equally among the characters in the party.\n\nConclusion\n\nWith hard work and a little luck, the adventurers have defeated the Black Spider and undone his destructive plots, cleared Phandalin of the ruffians who threatened its people, and reclaimed the lost mine of Wave Echo Cave. Their deeds will be long remembered in this corner of the Sword Coast. In years to come, the restored mines of the Phandelver\u2019s Pact will bring great riches to Phandalin and help establish peace and prosperity in the area.\n\nGundren and Nundro Rockseeker take over administration of the new mine. For the adventurers\u2019\n\nservice to their family, they gladly award the party a 10 percent share of the mine\u2019s profits. If the characters want to remain in Phandalin and perhaps restore Tresendar Manor or establish homes of their own, the people of the area are glad to have them stay. Even if they choose to move on in search of new adventures, they\u2019ll always have a warm welcome in Phandalin.\n\nBy the end of the adventure, the characters should be 5th level. If your players wish to continue playing their characters, you can use the contents of this set to create your own adventures; the mysterious map found in area 14 of Wave Echo Cave provides one possible adventure hook, but feel free to explore other ideas using the monsters, magic items, and locations in this adventure. If you want to create adventures for characters higher than 5th level, you\u2019ll need the basic rules online or the advanced rulebooks: the Player's Handbook, Dungeon Master\u2019s Guide, and Monster Manual.\n\nAppendix A: Magic Items\n\nEvery adventure holds the promise\u2014 but not a guarantee\u2014 of finding one or more magic items. Lost Mine of Phandelver contains an assortment of magic items that hints at the wider variety of magic items waiting to be found in the worlds of D&D. See the Dungeon Master\u2019s Guide for many more items.\n\nUsing a Magic Item\n\nA magic item\u2019s description explains how the item works. Handling a magic item is enough to give a character a sense that something is extraordinary about the item. Casting the identify spell on the item then reveals its properties. Alternatively, a character can concentrate on the item during a short rest, while being in physical contact with the item. At the end of the rest, the character learns the item\u2019s properties. Potions are an exception; a little taste is enough to tell the taster what the potion does.\n\nCertain magic items require a user to attune to them before their magical properties can be used. Attuning to a magic item requires that you spend a short rest concentrating on it (this can\u2019t be the same short rest used to learn an item\u2019s properties). Depending on the nature of the item, this concentration can take the form of prayers, weapon practice, or meditation. In any case, the concentration period must be uninterrupted. Once you are attuned to an item, you can use its magical properties.\n\nAn item can be attuned to only one creature at a time. A creature can be attuned to no more than three magic items at any given time, and you can attune yourself to only one item during a short rest."

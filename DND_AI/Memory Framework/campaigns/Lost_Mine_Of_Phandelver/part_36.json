You can also voluntarily end your attunement to an item with another short rest.\n\nItem Descriptions\n\n+1 Armor\n\nThe most basic form of magic armor is a superb product of physical and magical craft.

If your Strength is already 19 or higher, the gauntlets have no effect on you.\n\nPotion of Flying\n\nThis potion gives you a flying speed equal to your walking speed for 1 hour. If the potion wears off while you\u2019re flying and nothing else is holding you aloft, you must use your movement to descend. If you fail to land before 1 minute passes, you fall.\n\nAPPENDIX A: MAGIC ITEMS\n\nSpider Staff\n\nThe top of this black, adamantine staff is shaped like a spider. The staff weighs 6 pounds.

With the wand in hand, you can use your action to fire the magic missile spell from the wand\u2014 no components required\u2014 and expend 1 to 3 of the wand\u2019s charges.

You can use this wand even if you are incapable of casting spells.\n\nThe wand regains ld6 + 1 expended charges each day at dawn. If you expend the wand\u2019s last charge, roll a d20.

If the spell is on your class\u2019s spell list, you can use an action to read the scroll and cast its spell without having to provide any of the spell\u2019s components. Otherwise, the scroll is unintelligible.\n\nIf the spell is on your class\u2019s spell list but of a higher level than you can normally cast, you must make an ability check using your spellcasting ability to determine whether you cast it successfully. The DC equals 10 + the spell\u2019s level. On a failed check, the spell disappears from the scroll with no other effect.\n\nOnce the spell is cast, the words on the scroll fade, and the scroll itself crumbles to dust.\n\nAPPENDIX A: MAGIC ITEMS\n\nAppendix B: Monsters\n\nThis section contains stat blocks and short descriptions for the creatures that appear in Lost Mine of Phandelver.\n\nStatistics\n\nA creature\u2019s stat block provides the essential information that you, as the DM, need to run the creature.\n\nSize\n\nEach creature takes up a different amount of space. The Size Categories table shows how much space a creature of a particular size controls in combat. Objects sometimes use the same size categories.\n\nSize Categories\n\nSize\n\nSpace\n\nTiny\n\n2Vi by 2V2 ft.\n\nSmall\n\n5 by 5 ft.\n\nMedium\n\n5 by 5 ft.\n\nLarge\n\n10 by 10 ft.\n\nSpace\n\nA creature\u2019s space is the area in feet that it effectively controls in combat, not an expression of its physical dimensions. A typical Medium creature isn\u2019t 5 feet wide, for example, but it does control a space that wide. If a Medium hobgoblin stands in a 5-foot-wide doorway, other creatures can\u2019t get through unless the hobgoblin lets them.\n\nSqueezing into a Smaller Space\n\nA creature can squeeze through a space large enough for a creature one size smaller than itself. When squeezing through such a space, the creature\u2019s speed is halved.\n\nWhile squeezing, a creature has disadvantage on attack rolls and Dexterity saving throws, and attack rolls against it have advantage."

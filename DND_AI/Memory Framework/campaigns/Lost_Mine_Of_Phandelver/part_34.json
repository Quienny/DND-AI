  "content": "The ledge that hugs the south wall is 15 feet above water level. However, when water surges into the cave every 2 minutes, it raises the water level by 10 feet. After a minute, the water level returns to its normal depth of 20 feet.\n\n17. Old Streambed\n\nThe stream flowing from area 10 to area 18 used to continue through this low passage, eventually emptying out into area 16.\n\nThis passageway is barely four feet high and is obstructed by rounded boulders and pebbles. It might have been a streambed, though no water flows here now.\n\nThe dwarves diverted the stream into the channel leading to area 12 to drive the waterwheel in the smelter. Then the earthquakes that rocked Wave Echo Cave during the final spell battle of the ore invasion collapsed the floor in area\n\n18, diverting the stream once again. The old streambed remains as a usable passage that circumvents the undead in area 12, although Nezznar has not yet discovered this.\n\n18. Collapsed Cavern\n\nNezznar\u2019s servants occupy this cavern, guarding against undead incursions and carefully sifting through the rubble. The Black Spider\u2019s divinations suggest that some valuable treasure is hidden at the bottom of the rift that was created when this area was destroyed.\n\nA wide rift fills the eastern half of this cavern. A stream pours out of the west wall, then tumbles down into the rift and flows out again to the north. Several ropes are secured to iron stakes along on the western edge of the rift, leading down to the chasm floor.\n\nThree bugbears are stationed here. Two of them are clearing rock on the rift floor while one more stands guard in the western half of the cavern. A doppelganger named Vhalak supervises the operation in the guise of a male drow. If a fight breaks out in the main cavern, the two bugbears in the rift climb up the ropes to join the fray.\n\nRift The rift is 20 feet deep. Climbing up or down without using a rope requires a successful DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check. A creature that fails the check by 5 or more falls and takes ld6 bludgeoning damage per 10 feet fallen, landing prone at the bottom.\n\nDevelopments\n\nIf two or more bugbears are killed, the doppelganger tries to retreat to area 19 to warn Nezznar.\n\nTreasure\n\nNezznar\u2019s divinations are accurate. Buried under heavy rubble at the bottom of the rift is the crushed skeleton of a dwarf wearing gauntlets of ogre power. The remains are hidden from view but can be found with a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check. Each character searching can attempt one check per hour.\n\n19. Temp le of Dumathoin\n\nNezznar uses this room as his headquarters while he explores the mines and searches for the Forge of Spells.\n\nSix cracked marble pillars line the walls of this hall, at the north end of which stands a nine-foot-tall statue of a dwarf seated on a throne, a mighty stone warhammer across his lap. Large emeralds gleam in the statue\u2019s eyes.\n\nThe dust and debris covering the floor has been swept to one side, and a campsite of sorts now spreads in front of the statue. Haifa dozen bedrolls and packs are neatly arranged around a rough-built fire pit. A wooden table stands on the west side of the room between two pillars.\n\nIf the room\u2019s occupants are not aware of the characters as they enter, add the following:\n\nTwo bugbears stand by the table, flanking a dark elf dressed in black leather armor and robes. He clutches a black staff with a carved spider at the top and frowns as he sees you.\n\n\u201cIt seems that I must deal with you myself. A pity it must end this way.\u201d\n\nNezznar the Black Spider is joined by four giant spiders\n\nthat defend their master to the death. If they are expecting trouble, the spiders hide behind pillars, and Nezznar casts invisibility on himself and stands near the table. Make a Dexterity (Stealth) check for the spiders. When intruders appear, the spiders try to entangle them in webs before closing to melee range. Nezznar joins the fray on the round after the spiders attack.\n\nIf the doppelganger from area 18 retreated to this area, it assumes the guise of Nundro Rockseeker so that Nezznar can use the \u201cdwarf\u201d as leverage to force the party\u2019s surrender (although the drow won\u2019t actually harm the doppelganger). See the \u201cRoleplaying Nezznar\u201d section for more information on the drow villain.\n\nStatue. The statue depicts Dumathoin, the dwarven god of mining. Any character who has proficiency in Religion recognizes the deity. The statue is beautifully carved, and its emerald eyes appear extremely valuable. However, the jewels are clever fakes made of worthless glass, as close inspection and a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check reveals. Nevertheless, a powerful spell protects them, and a detect magic spell reveals a strong aura of abjuration magic surrounding the statue.\n\nA character can climb the statue easily and pry a jewel loose with a successful DC 10 Strength check. However, if either eye is removed, the pillars that line the walls crack, triggering a ceiling collapse. Each creature in the room must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 4dl0\n\nPART 4: WAVE ECHO CAVE\n\n49\n\nNezznar the Black Spioer\n\nDevelopments\n\nThe creatures in area 18 can hear sounds of combat in this room. If they haven\u2019t already been dealt with, they arrive after 3 rounds and act immediately after Nezznar\u2019s giant spiders in the initiative count.\n\nIf the characters capture Nezznar and deliver him to the townmaster\u2019s hall in Phandalin, the drow is locked up until Sildar Hallwinter or another representative of the Lords\u2019 Alliance can escort him to Neverwinter to face justice and interrogation. However, unless the characters post guards outside Nezznar\u2019s cell, Halia Thornton (see page 17) breaks him out of jail, smuggles him out of Phandalin, and delivers him into the waiting arms of the Zhentarim. The Zhents want to learn everything the Black Spider knows about Wave Echo Cave. What happens to Nezznar at that point is up to you.\n\nTreasure\n\nNezznar carries a potion of healing and a spider staff. In addition, the drow carries an iron key with a head shaped like an anvil. This key unlocks the door to area 20."

A crevasse divides the cavern and is flanked by two rough stone columns that support the twenty-foot-high ceiling. Two arched wooden bridges span the chasm.\n\nBridges. These bridges are made of wooden planks and have no rails. The south one is rigged to collapse when a creature weighing more than 50 pounds moves across it. A character next to the bridge can discern that the construction is faulty with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check. Any creature can use an action to dislodge one end of either bridge, dropping it into the crevasse.\n\nCrevasse. This steep-sided fissure is 5 to 10 feet wide and 20 feet deep. Its rough walls are easily climbed without an ability check. A creature that falls into the crevasse takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage and lands prone in a jumble of rubble that is difficult terrain (see \u201cDifficult Terrain\u201d in the rulebook).\n\nThe bottom of the crevasse feels unnaturally cold. When viewed with a detect magic spell, the area emanates a faint necromantic aura. The magic causes all organic matter in the crevasse to age and decompose at half the normal rate.\n\nCurrently heaped at the bottom among broken and well- gnawed bones is the half-eaten body of Thel Dendrar, the woodcarver of Phandalin who was murdered by the Redbrands. The outlaws left his corpse here for the nothic to feed on.\n\nTreasure\n\nThe nothic keeps its hoard in a battered wooden chest hidden in a cubbyhole at the bottom of the crevasse, under the north bridge. The chest can\u2019t be seen from the edge of the crevasse, but is obvious to any character who descends\n\nThe guardian of this cave is a nothic\u2014 an insane subterranean monster that hungers for flesh. The creature, lured by a faint magical effect emanating from the crevasse, was occupying the area when the Redbrands moved in. Iarno managed to strike a bargain with the monster, convincing it to help guard the stronghold in exchange for treasure and the occasional gift of fresh meat. Still, the nothic is untrustworthy.\n\nThe nothic lurks near the west ends of the two bridges.\n\nIf it notices intruders entering the cave, it hides behind one of the large stone columns and watches them, attempting to use its Weird Insight (see the creature\u2019s stat block) to discern the characters\u2019 secrets.\n\nThe nothic communicates using telepathy. If detected, it prefers to negotiate and isn\u2019t above betraying the Redbrands for the right incentive, such as the promise of food. When roleplaying the nothic, consider speaking in whispers and throwing in some mad cackles and bits of gibberish. Also be sure to mention that the creature isn\u2019t actually talking but rather filling the characters\u2019 heads with its foul murmurings and demands for food. The nothic knows everything the Redbrands know; see the \u201cWhat the Redbrands Know\u201d sidebar on page 20.\n\nNothic\n\nPA RT 2 : PH A DA LI\n\ninto the fissure. The chest contains 160 sp, 120 gp, five malachite gems (15 gp each), two potions of healing, and a scroll of augury.\n\nThe chest also holds a +1 longsword in a silver-chased scabbard. The sword is inscribed with the name \u201cTalon, and its hilt is worked in the shape of a bird of prey with outspread wings. It once belonged to a great knight named Aldith Tresendar, known as the Black Hawk. A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (History) check recognizes the sword and recalls this lore.\n\nSir Aldith died fighting off the ores that attacked through the hidden caverns below his manor. Talon was lost here until the nothic found it.\n\nAwarding Experience Points\n\nDivide 450 XP equally among the characters if the party\n\ndefeats the nothic or negotiates a truce with it.\n\n9. Guard Barracks\n\nA character who listens at this door with a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check hears several gruff voices issuing demeaning commands in the Goblin tongue. Examples include \u201cLick the floor! and Roll like a dog!\n\nThe bugbears here are bullying their goblin slave.\n\nThis barracks contains four roughly built wooden bunks, with heaped-up blankets and dirty dishes scattered about. A strong smell of unwashed bodies and rotten meat fills the air. Three tall, furry humanoids are lounging among the mess, barking orders at a sad little goblin that demeans itself for their amusement. Your sudden appearance causes the goblin | to faint.\n\nThree bugbears and one goblin are present. The goblin, Droop, falls unconscious at the sight of the party, but another creature can use an action to wake him. Otherwise, Droop remains unconscious for Id 10 minutes.\n\nThe bugbears work for the Black Spider and were sent here to help larno keep the Redbrands and the citizens of Phandalin in line. The leader is named Mosk. He wears a jeweled eye patch even though he has both his eyes. Mosk wears the eye patch because he thinks it\u2019s fancy.\n\nThe bugbears avoid the human members of the Redbrands. If the characters are wearing scarlet cloaks taken from elsewhere, the bugbears assume that they serve larno. Clever characters might even persuade the bugbears to help deal with \u201ctraitors\u201d or \u201cimpostors\u201d elsewhere in the dungeon. If you don t think the players are doing a great job roleplaying the deception, you can have the character who is doing most of the talking make a DC 15 Charisma (Deception) check to convince the bugbears to do what the party wants.\n\nRoleplaying Droop\n\nThe goblin, Droop, is not a threat to the party. He has been cowed by the bugbears and follows their orders until someone stronger comes along.\n\nIf he regains consciousness during combat, Droop hides and avoids the fight. He is such a coward that if\n\nhe is ordered to fight, he does so with disadvantage (as explained in the rulebook).\n\nDroop knows the general layout of the Redbrand hideout, as well as the location of its secret doors and traps. He doesn\u2019t think to offer up the information, but if prompted, he reveals as much as he can remember in an attempt to be useful to the party. Some of the details might be confusing or mixed up. He is a goblin, after all."

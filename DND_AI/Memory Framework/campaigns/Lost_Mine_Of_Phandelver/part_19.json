  "content": "If the rat in area 1 1 warns him that trouble is approaching, Iarno the evil mage grabs his staff of defense (see appendix A) and the scrolls in his chest (see the \u201cTreasure\u201d section), and flees through the secret door in the northeast corner of the room. In his haste, Iarno leaves behind a letter from the Black Spider (see the \u201cDevelopments\u201d section) and neglects to make sure the secret door is closed all the way. Characters gain advantage on ability checks made to find the slightly ajar secret door (see \u201cAdvantage and Disadvantage\u201d in the rulebook). For more information on secret doors, see the \u201cGeneral Features\u201d section (page 20).\n\nIf he manages to escape, Iarno flees to area 1 (through areas 7 and 8) and grabs the satchel hidden in the cistern there. If the nothic is still alive in area 8, Iarno instructs it to waylay any pursuers. If the characters catch up to him, Iarno quaffs the potion of invisibility in the satchel and flees the hideout. At your discretion, he could reappear later in the adventure.\n\nRoleplaying Iarno\n\nA former member of the Lords\u2019 Alliance, Iarno seized an opportunity in Phandalin to line his own pockets. Originally tasked with setting up a constabulary, the mage\n\n11. Wizard\u2019s Workshop\n\nFaint bubbling and dripping sounds can be heard through either door of this room with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check.\n\nThis room appears to be a wizard's workshop. A rat scurries across the floor and takes refuge under a large worktable set up with alembics, retorts, distillation coils, and other alchemical devices, all of it stewing and bubbling away. Bookshelves are crowded with sheaves of parchment and strange-looking tomes.\n\nPART 2: PHANDALIN\n\n26\n\nPART 2: PHANDALIN\n\nThe Black Spider is a drow (dark elf). The Black Spider sent three bugbears to help Iarno keep the population of Phandalin under control, but the Redbrands have managed without them. The bugbears know the way to Wave Echo Cave, but Iarno does not. The Black Spider is searching Wave Echo Cave for the Forge of Spells. Dwarves and gnomes of the Phandelver\u2019s Pact used the magical forge to fashion powerful magic items.\n\n\u2022 No other members of the Lords\u2019 Alliance know of Iarno\u2019s betrayal.\n\nDevelopments\n\nVarious papers and notes are stacked neatly on the desk, mostly consisting of Iarno\u2019s written orders to apothecaries and alchemists in nearby settlements for more materials for his workshop. The characters also find a letter signed with the Black Spider\u2019s symbol.\n\nLord Albrek,\n\nMy spies in Neverwinter tell me that strangers are due to arrive in Phandalin. They could be working for the dwarves. Capture them if you can, kill them if you must, but don\u2019t allow them to upset our plans. See that any dwarven maps in their possession are delivered to me with haste.\n\nI\u2019m counting on you, Iarno. Don\u2019t disappoint me.\n\nIf Iarno is taken into custody, Sildar Hallwinter arranges to have the wizard incarcerated in the townmaster\u2019s hall until he can be safely transported back to Neverwinter. Whether Iarno stands trial for his crimes is beyond the scope of this adventure. The Black Spider is too preoccupied to meddle in the wizard\u2019s fate.\n\nTreasure\n\nAt the foot of Iarno\u2019s bed is a sturdy, unlocked wooden chest holding the best pickings of the Redbrands\u2019 loot over the last two months. It contains 180 sp, 130 gp, and a silk pouch containing five carnelians (10 gp each), two peridots (15 gp each), and one pearl (100 gp). It also contains two magic items that Iarno brought with him from Neverwinter: a scroll of charm person and a scroll of fireball.\n\nIarno also wields a staff of defense (see appendix A).\n\nAwarding Experience Points Divide 200 XP equally among the characters if the party slays Iarno Albrek. Double the XP award if they capture Iarno and deliver him to Sildar Hallwinter in Phandalin.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next?\n\nThe next stage of the adventure continues with part 3, \u201cThe Spider\u2019s Web,\u201d in which the characters undertake a number of short adventures that advance the story. At some point during part 2, the characters are likely to advance to 3rd level, so make sure the players are keeping track of their XP.\n\ninstead assembled a group of outlaws and local ruffians to secure his own position in town.\n\nIarno knew of the Black Spider through his contacts in the Lords\u2019 Alliance and brokered a meeting. The drow promised to share the secrets and wealth of the Forge of Spells with the wizard in exchange for his help and loyalty.\n\nIarno puts on airs of gentility and courteous manners, addressing his ruffians as \u201cmy good gentlemen,\u201d and referring to sordid acts such as kidnapping or arson as \u201cthat unpleasant little business\u201d or \u201cthose unfortunate events.\u201d He refers to the characters as \u201cguests\u201d and expresses regret that he cannot provide suitable entertainment for their visit. Beneath his genteel demeanor, however, Iarno is just as thuggish and arrogant as any Redbrand outlaws.\n\nIf threatened, Iarno uses his staff of defense to cast mage armor on himself. He then casts offensive spells at enemies he can see. larno\u2019s stat block contains a list of the spells he has prepared. For descriptions of those spells and their effects, see the rulebook. Iarno uses the shield power of his staff for added protection.\n\nIf he is reduced to 8 or fewer hit points and has no avenues of escape, Iarno surrenders. He values his life more than anything, and he remains a model prisoner in the hopes that the Black Spider will somehow learn of his predicament and \u201carrange for his freedom.\u201d\n\nIf he is questioned while in captivity, Iarno relates the following information, all of which is true:\n\nIn this part of the adventure, the characters follow up on existing leads and lines of inquiry. They can\u2019t learn much more in Phandalin, so they need to set out into the forests and hills surrounding the town to uncover the larger plots they are caught up in. The characters are not required to visit all the locations in this section.\n\nDepending on which NPCs the characters met and which quests or clues they picked up, some or all the following information might be known to them:"

  "content": "Daran is concerned about the Redbrands, and he would like to see a group of adventurers teach the ruffians a lesson. He tells the characters that it\u2019s time someone took a stand against the Redbrands\u2019 leader, Glasstaff. Daran knows the Redbrands hang around the Sleeping Giant tap house, but he can also tell the characters that the main Redbrand safe house lies under Tresendar Manor, the ruin at the east edge of town. (See the \u201cTresendar Manor\u201d section for more information.)\n\nQuest: Old Owl Trouble . Daran has heard stories from prospectors in the hills northeast of Phandalin that someone is digging around in the ruins known as Old Owl Well. More disturbingly, several prospectors have reported being chased from the area by undead. He asks the characters to visit the ruins, a couple days march northeast of Phandalin, and find out who\u2019s there and what they\u2019re up to. Daran knows that the ruins are an old watchtower of an ancient magical empire known as Netheril, and he worries that dangerous magic might be dormant there. If the party pursues this quest, see \u201cOld Owl Well\u201d (page 29).\n\nJoining the Order of the Gauntlet If the party deals with the Redbrands and investigates Old Owl Well, Daran Edermath privately approaches certain members of the group to urge them to join the Order of the Gauntlet. He speaks with those who exemplify the virtues of the order, such as honor and vigilance. If a character agrees, Daran awards the person the title of Chevall.\n\nLionshield Coster\n\nHanging above the front door of this modest trading post is a sign shaped like a wooden shield with a blue lion painted on it.\n\nThis building is owned by the Lionshields, a merchant company based in the city of Yartar, over a hundred miles to the east. They ship finished goods to Phandalin and other small settlements throughout the region, but this outpost has been hard hit by banditry. The most recent Lionshield caravan due in Phandalin never arrived. (It was attacked and its cargo captured by the Cragmaw goblins.)\n\nPART 2: PHANDALIN\n\nHoffr iHoar\"\n\nhi; :mm\n\nS'\n\nSister 1 M Garaele\u2019s;rj^> Hornet \"SK\n\nPhandalin\n\nSfe- ^ (\\\\ jV- Barthe ns , L i ^Provisiohs\u2019*\n\n: Hart hcii's\n\n*; -I\n\n\u2018Jv\\ rv/, a//\n\n, ....\n\nO'- '..^J^rreserKiarMano^\n\n: \\ \u2022 \u2022Eciemiath-\n\njaMS SBfRr\n\nSleeping?:^\n\nWrj?'\u00a3? pm >. -sf.\n\nrStonemlPInn:\n\nTown i Green\n\nLineric s .

She knows that bandits have raided Lionshield caravans, but she doesn\u2019t know who is responsible.\n\nIn a back room, Linene keeps a supply of armor and weapons, all of which are for sale to interested buyers.\n\n(For prices, see \u201cAdventuring Gear\u201d in the rulebook.) Linene has a few scruples, however, and won\u2019t sell weapons to anyone she thinks might be a threat to the town. Among those with whom she refuses to do business are the Redbrands. She warns the characters that the ruffians are trouble and advises them to avoid the Sleeping Giant tap house.\n\nRecovered Goods. If the characters return the stolen goods found in area 8 of the Cragmaw hideout (or if they left the goods but reveal where they can be found), Linene gives them a reward of 50 gp and promises to help the adventurers any way she can.\n\nPhandalin Miner\u2019s Exchange\n\nThe Miner\u2019s Exchange is a trading post where local miners have their valuable finds weighed, measured, and paid out. In the absence of any local lord or authority, the exchange also serves as an unofficial records office, registering claims to various streams and excavations around the area. There isn\u2019t any real gold rush in Phandalin, but enough wealth is hidden in the nearby streams and valleys to support a good number of independent prospectors.\n\nThe exchange is a great place to meet people who spend a lot of time out and about in the countryside surrounding Phandalin. The guildmaster is an ambitious and calculating human woman named Halia Thornton.\n\nIn her attempts to establish the Miner\u2019s Exchange as the closest thing the town has to a governing authority, she acts as more than a simple merchant. She is also an agent of the Zhentarim, a powerful organization that seeks to exert secret control over the North through wealth and influence. Halia is working slowly to bring Phandalin under her control, and can become a valuable patron to the characters if they don\u2019t cross her.\n\nHalia doesn\u2019t know the location of Cragmaw Castle, but she has heard that the Redbrands have a goblin minion serving them. She suggests the goblin might know the location. She leverages this information to try to persuade the characters into helping her deal with the Redbrands.\n\nQuest: Halia\u2019s Job Offer. If approached by characters she believes she can control, Halia explains that the Redbrands are a problem. She tells how the ruffians loiter around the Sleeping Giant tap house and have a base under Tresendar Manor, on the east edge of town.\n\nShe then offers the characters 100 gp to eliminate the Redbrand leader, whom the outlaws call Glasstaff, and bring her any correspondence found in the leader\u2019s quarters. Halia doesn\u2019t reveal that she wants to take over the Redbrand operation herself. A DC 1 5 Wisdom (Insight) check indicates she has ulterior motives for wanting the Redbrand leader dead.\n\nJoining the Zhentarim\n\nIf the party disposes of the Redbrand leader, Halia Thornton approaches certain members of the group to urge them to join the Zhentarim. She speaks with those who share the Zhentarim\u2019s pursuits, such as wealth and power. Even if the party wipes out the Redbrand gang, Halia might still extend the offer in an effort to gain friends (and spies) within the party. If a character agrees, Halia gives the individual the title of Fang.\n\nAlderleaf Farm\n\nA wise female halfling of forty-five, Qelline Alderleaf is a pragmatic farmer who seems to know everything that goes on in town. She is a kind host, and is willing to let the characters stay in her hayloft if they don\u2019t want to stay at the Stonehill Inn."

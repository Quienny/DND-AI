  "content": "Type\n\nA creature\u2019s type speaks to its fundamental nature.\n\nThe following types of monsters can be encountered in this adventure.\n\nAberrations. Utterly alien beings that have no place in the natural world.\n\nBeasts. Nonhumanoid creatures that, like real-world animals, are a normal part of the world\u2019s ecology. Dragons. Large, winged, reptilian creatures of ancient origin and tremendous power.\n\nGiants. Humanoid-like creatures that tower over humans and their kin.\n\nHumanoids. Bipedal peoples of the civilized and savage world, including humans and a tremendous variety of other races, including dwarves and elves. Monstrosities. Frightening creatures that sometimes resemble beasts but that are often touched by magic and almost never benign.\n\nOozes. Gelatinous creatures that generally have no fixed shape. They are mostly subterranean, dwelling in caves and dungeons.\n\nPlants. Plant creatures, as opposed to ordinary plants, have some degree of sentience and mobility.\n\nUndead. Once-living creatures brought to a horrifying state of undeath through the practice of necromantic magic or some unholy curse.\n\nTags\n\nA creature might have one or more tags appended to its type, in parentheses. For example, an ore has the humanoid (ore) type. These parenthetical tags provide an additional layer of categorization for certain monsters, but they have no bearing on how a monster is used in combat.\n\nAlignment\n\nA creature\u2019s alignment provides a clue to its disposition.\n\nFor example, a chaotic evil creature might be difficult to reason with and might attack characters on sight, whereas a neutral creature might be willing to negotiate. Alignment indicates whether a creature leans toward law or chaos and good or evil or whether a creature is neutral.\n\nAny Alignment Some creatures, such as the warrior, can have any alignment. In other words, you choose the creature\u2019s alignment. Depending on the creature, its alignment entry might indicate a tendency or aversion toward law, chaos, good, or evil.\n\nUnaligned. Many creatures of low intelligence have no comprehension of law or chaos, good or evil. They don\u2019t make moral or ethical choices, but rather act on instinct. These creatures are unaligned, which means they don\u2019t have an alignment.\n\nArmor Glass\n\nA creature that wears armor or carries a shield has an AC that takes its armor, shield, and Dexterity into account. Otherwise, a creature\u2019s AC is based on its Dexterity modifier and any natural armor or supernatural resilience it might possess.\n\nIf a creature wears armor or carries a shield, the kind of armor it wears or shield it carries is noted in parentheses after its AC value.\n\nHit Points\n\nA creature usually dies or is destroyed when its hit points drop to 0. For more on hit points, see the rulebook.\n\nSpeed\n\nA creature\u2019s speed tells you how far it can move on its turn. For more information on speed, see the rulebook.\n\nAll creatures have a walking speed; creatures that have no form of ground-based locomotion have a speed of 0 feet.\n\nMany of the creatures herein have one or more additional movement modes.\n\nClimb. A creature that has a climbing speed can use all or part of its movement to move on vertical surfaces. The creature doesn\u2019t need to spend extra movement to climb.\n\nFly. A creature that has a flying speed can use all or part of its movement to fly. If the creature is incapacitated or knocked prone while flying, it falls unless it can hover.\n\nSwim. A creature that has a swimming speed doesn\u2019t need to spend extra movement to swim.\n\n54\n\nAPPENDIX B: MONSTERS\n\nAbility Scores\n\nry creature has six ability scores (Strength, Dexterity, Cor. a : r. IrveLigence, Wisdom, and Charisma) and cc rrfs> : r. ling m jdifiers. For more information on ability sc : res =r. 2 how they re used in play, see the rulebook.\n\nSaving Throws\n\nThe Saving Throws entry is reserved for creatures that are particularly adept at resisting certain kinds of effects.\n\nSkills\n\nThe Skills entry is reserved for creatures that are proficient in one or more skills. For example, a creature that is very perceptive and stealthy might have higher- than-normal bonuses to Wisdom (Perception) and Dexterity (Stealth) checks.\n\nSkills in a monster\u2019s stat block are shown with the total modifier\u2014 the monster\u2019s ability modifier plus its proficiency bonus. If a monster\u2019s stat block says \u201cStealth +6,\u201d roll a d20 and add 6 when the monster makes an ability check using Stealth.\n\nJL\n\nArmor, Weapon, and Tool Proficiencies\n\nAssume that a creature is proficient with its armor, weapons, and tools. If you swap out a creature\u2019s armor and weapons, you must decide whether the creature is proficient with its new equipment. See the rulebook for what happens when you use these items without proficiency.\n\nVulnerabilities, Resistances, and Immunities\n\nSome creatures have vulnerability, resistance, or immunity to certain types of damage. Additionally, some creatures are immune to certain conditions and other game effects. These immunities are also noted here.\n\nSenses\n\nThe Senses entry notes a creature\u2019s passive Wisdom (Perception) score, as well as any special senses the creature might have, such as the following senses.\n\nBlindsight. A creature with blindsight can perceive its surroundings without having to rely on sight, within a specific radius.\n\nDarkvision . A creature with darkvision can see in the dark within a specific radius. The creature can see in dim light within the radius as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. The creature can\u2019t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.\n\nTruesight. A creature with truesight can see in normal and magical darkness, see invisible creatures and objects, automatically detect visual illusions and succeed on saving throws against them, and perceive the original form of a shapechanger or a creature that is transformed by magic. Furthermore, the creature can see into the Ethereal Plane.\n\nLanguages\n\nThe languages that a creature can speak are listed in alphabetical order. Sometimes a creature can understand a language but not speak it, and this is noted in its entry."

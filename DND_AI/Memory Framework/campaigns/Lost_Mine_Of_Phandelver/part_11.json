  "content": "The following sections detail specific locations in town.\n\nStonehill Inn\n\nIn the center of town stands a large, newly built roadhouse of fieldstone and rough-hewn timbers. The common room is filled with locals nursing mugs of ale or cider, all of them eyeing you with curiosity.\n\nThis modest inn has six rooms for rent (Sildar Hallwinter takes one). If the characters decide to stay here, see \u201cFood, Drink, and Lodging\u201d in the rulebook for pricing. (The characters\u2019 other alternative for lodging is to camp outside the town, or to persuade a farmer such as Daran Edermath or Qelline Alderleaf to let them sleep in a hayloft.)\n\nThe proprietor is a short, friendly young human male named Toblen Stonehill. Toblen is a native of the town of Triboar to the east. He came to Phandalin to prospect, but soon realized that he knew a lot more about running an inn than he did about mining. The new town offered a good opportunity to become established. Toblen is upset that the Redbrands have been allowed to terrorize the town, and that Harbin Wester, the townmaster, has done nothing to curtail them. However, he tries not to stir up trouble for fear that the Redbrands might retaliate against his wife and children.\n\nRumors. Spending a little time in the common room and chatting up the townspeople can provide the characters with a number of good leads to explore in and around town. NPCs present in the Stonehill Inn and the rumors they pass on include:\n\n\u2022 Narth, an old farmer: \u201cSister Garaele, who oversees the Shrine of Luck, recently left town for a few days, then returned wounded and exhausted.\u201d (See the \u201cShrine of Luck\u201d section for more information.)\n\n\u2022 Elsa, a gossipy barmaid: \u201cDaran Edermath, the orchard keeper, is a former adventurer.\u201d (See the \u201cEdermath Orchard\u201d section for more information.)\n\n\u2022 Lanar, a miner: \u201cOre raiders have been seen on the east end of Triboar Trail. The townmaster is looking for someone to run them off.\u201d (See the \u201cTownmaster\u2019s Hall\u201d section for more information.)\n\n\u2022 Trilena, the innkeeper\u2019s wife: \u201cThel Dendrar, a local woodcarver, stood up to the Redbrands a tenday ago when they came by his shop and leered at his wife. The ruffians murdered him. Several townsfolk saw it happen. The Redbrands grabbed his body, and now his wife, daughter, and son have gone missing too.\u201d (Unknown\n\nPART 2: PHANDAU\n\nto Trilena and the other townsfolk, the Redbrands took Thel\u2019s wife and children to their secret hideout.)\n\n\u2022 Pip, Toblen\u2019s young son: \u201cQelline Alderleaf s son Carp said he found a secret tunnel in the woods, but Redbrands almost caught him.\u201d (See the \u201cAlderleaf Farm\u201d section for more information.)\n\n\u2022 Freda, a weaver: \u201cThe Redbrands hassle every business in town, except for the Phandalin Miner\u2019s Exchange. They don\u2019t want trouble with Halia Thornton, who runs it.\u201d (See the \u201cPhandalin Miner\u2019s Exchange\u201d section for more information.)\n\nThese leads should point the characters toward opportunities for adventure in and around Phandalin. In addition, any NPC at the inn can tell the characters that the Redbrands frequent the Sleeping Giant tap house at the east end of town\u2014 and that the ruffians are trouble.\n\nBarthen\u2019s Provisions\n\nBarthen\u2019s is the biggest trading post in Phandalin. Its shelves stock most ordinary goods and supplies, including backpacks, bedrolls, rope, and rations. The place is open from sunup to sundown. Barthen\u2019s does not stock weapons or armor, but characters can purchase other adventuring gear here, with the exception of items that cost more than 25 gp. (For prices, see \u201cAdventuring Gear\u201d in the rulebook.) Characters in need of weapons or armor are directed to the Lionshield Coster (see that section).\n\nThe proprietor is Elmar Barthen, a lean and balding human male shopkeeper of fifty years with a kindly manner. He employs a couple young clerks (Ander and Thistle) who help load and unload wagons, and who wait on customers when Barthen isn\u2019t around.\n\nDelivering the Supplies . If the characters began play with the \u201cMeet Me in Phandalin\u201d adventure hook, their orders are to deliver the wagon of supplies to Barthen\u2019s. Barthen pays the agreed amount (10 gp to each character) and takes possession of the wagon and its supplies. If the characters tell him of Gundren Rockseeker\u2019s capture, Barthen is saddened by the news and encourages the party to find and rescue the dwarf. He considers Gundren a friend and was excited by talk of discovering the lost mine of the Phandelver\u2019s Pact in the nearby hills. If the party hasn\u2019t already learned details of the mine from Sildar Hallwinter, a character who succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (History) check can relate the information from the first two paragraphs of the \u201cBackground\u201d section at the start of the adventure.\n\nBarthen also mentions that two more Rockseeker brothers, Nundro and Tharden, are camped somewhere outside town. Barthen hasn\u2019t seen them in a tenday and expects the brothers to return \u201cany day now\u201d to resupply. What Barthen doesn\u2019t know is that Tharden is dead and Nundro is a prisoner in the mine. See part 4, the \u201cWave Echo Cave\u201d section, for more information.\n\nBarthen f s News. If the characters ask Barthen how business is going, the shopkeeper tells them that the Redbrands are making it hard on everyone, shaking down local businesses and flouting the townmaster\u2019s authority.\n\nIf the characters seem of a mind to do something about it, he tells them that the Redbrands frequent the Sleeping Giant tap house.\n\nEdermath Orchard\n\nDaran Edermath is a retired adventurer who lives in a tidy little cottage beside an apple orchard. A fit, silver- haired half-elf well over a hundred years old, Daran is a fighter who served as a marshal and herald for many years in the lands of the Dragon Coast, far to the southeast.\n\nUpon retiring, he returned to the Neverwinter region, his original home.\n\nDaran is a member of the Order of the Gauntlet, a devout and vigilant group that seeks to protect others from the depredations of evildoers. The order is always vigilant, ready to smite evil, enforce justice, and enact retribution against any who try to subjugate or harm others. Though he is no longer active in the order, he keeps an eye on happenings around Phandalin. He is happy to trade news with fellow adventurers, especially those who appear to hold to these virtues."

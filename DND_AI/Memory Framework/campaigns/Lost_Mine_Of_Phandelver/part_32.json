  "content": "A character who explores the pool finds an old skeleton lying on the bottom, 10 feet from the shore and under 10 feet of water. These are the remains of a human wizard from old Phandalin who died defending the mines against the ore attackers. Several ore arrows are still lodged in the skeleton\u2019s ribcage.\n\nTreasure\n\nThe skeleton wears two platinum rings (75 gp each) and clutches a wand of magic missiles in its bony fingers.\n\n11. North Barracks\n\nThe eastern door is barricaded from inside the room and requires a successful DC 20 Strength check to force open. A character who listens at either door and succeeds on a DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check hears gruff voices speaking Goblin and talking about how hungry they are.\n\nOld stone bunks line the walls of this barracks, which is lit and heated by a glowing iron brazier in the middle of the room.\n\nIf the party enters from the west, add:\n\n( \u00bb i\n\nAcross the room is another door, this one blocked by a barricade made from the remains of a wooden table.\n\nFive bugbears reside in this chamber. They are loyal minions of Nezznar. This room marks the front line in the Black Spider\u2019s assault on Wave Echo Cave, and the bugbears are here to prevent ghouls, zombies, or other undead from troubling their master in his lair (area 19).\n\nLike area 6, this was formerly a barracks for miners. Nezznar\u2019s bugbears removed the corpses they found here and built the barricade.\n\nTreasure\n\nThe largest bugbear carries a pouch containing 15 cp, 13 ep, and a potion of vitality.\n\n12. Smelter Cavern\n\nLike the fungi cavern at area 8, this chamber poses a serious obstacle that prevents Nezznar from reaching his objective\u2014 the Forge of Spells (area 15). The drow is still formulating a plan to get past the undead guardians in this area.\n\nA blast furnace and a mechanical bellows powered by a waterwheel dominate this large chamber. The furnace is cold and dark, but heaps of coal are piled nearby, along with carts full of unrefined ore. The waterwheel sits in a ten-foot-wide channel cut into the floor of the room, but the channel is dry. Passages exit to the west, south, and east. The empty channel exits to the north and east.\n\nMore than a dozen withered corpses are scattered around the room. These slain dwarves and ores are still wearing the remnants of their armor. Floating above them is a skull engulfed in green flame.\n\nEight of the fallen dwarf warriors are zombies. They rise and pursue any living creatures that enter the room, but they do not pursue creatures outside this area for more than 1 round. In addition, a far more intelligent undead guards this area: a flameskull. This creature was a servant of the human wizards allied with the Phandelver dwarves and gnomes, and it continues to act on ancient instructions to prevent intruders from passing through.\n\nThis impressive chamber was the heart of the Wave Echo Cave mining operation. Here, the dwarves melted down their ore to refine ingots of silver, gold, and platinum. The dry channel is where the dwarves diverted the stream from area 18 to power the waterwheel here. That in turn operated the bellows that fed the furnace.\n\nThe channel\u2019s bottom is 5 feet below floor level, and no ability check is required to scramble in or out. Characters in the channel can follow it out of this room to the north or to the east, though the ceiling is only 5 feet high after the channel exits this room.\n\n46\n\nPART 4: WAVE ECHO CAVE\n\n13. Starry Cavern\n\nThe structural damage and the skeletal remains in this area are evidence of the destructive spell battle fought here centuries ago when the ores and their mercenary wizards stormed the mines.\n\nGlittering minerals in the ceiling of this large cavern catch the light and send it back to create the impression of a starry night sky. Dozens of skeletons \u2014 many crushed under fallen debris \u2014 are scattered across the floor.\n\nThe cave is large enough that it contains two freestanding structures. Each of these stone buildings is proportioned for human use, as opposed to the dwarf-sized doorways and furnishings you\u2019ve seen elsewhere in the mines. Both structures have battered and blackened masonry walls, their double doors cracked and scorched.\n\nThe cavern is divided by an escarpment, into which a flight of stairs has been cut. Passages lead out of this area to the north, south, and west.\n\nThe damaged buildings are described in areas 14 and 15. Minerals in the ceiling are pretty, but they are neither magical nor valuable.\n\nAny character proficient in Arcana can sense a subtle aura of magic in this cavern. (A detect magic spell reveals the same.) The aura becomes stronger as one approaches the northern building (area 15).\n\n14. Wizards\u2019 Quarters\n\nThe doors leading into this area are cracked, their iron hinges partially melted. Wrenching or smashing open the doors requires a successful DC 15 Strength check.\n\nDust, ash, walls blackened by fire, and heaps of debris beneath the sagging ceiling show that this room was damaged by a destructive blast. The furnishings \u2014 tables, chairs, bookshelves, beds \u2014 are charred or splintered, but otherwise well preserved. A scorched iron chest stands near the foot of one of the beds.\n\nThis room contains the restless spirit of the last wizard to die here: Mormesk the wraith. He is not immediately visible but rises up out of the floor when a living creature enters the room.\n\nMormesk was a powerful mage until he met his end in the spell battle at the climax of the ore attack. Centuries of anger have poisoned his soul, transforming him into a hate-filled apparition.\n\nMormesk leads the undead that haunt Wave Echo Cave. The wraith spends his time here because the treasure he had amassed in life is in the scorched chest (see the \u201cTreasure\u201d section). No longer corporeal, he cannot touch or possess the wealth he enjoyed in life.\n\nThis building served as a guesthouse for visiting wizards working in the Forge of Spells (area 15), most of whom were humans from nearby cities. The furnishings are all human proportioned.\n\nRoleplaying Mormesk"

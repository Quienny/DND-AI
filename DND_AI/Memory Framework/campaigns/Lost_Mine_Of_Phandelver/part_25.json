Weaver\u2019s Cottage\n\nThis fallen cottage is a lure for the creatures that lair nearby.\n\nHeaps of wreckage litter the interior of this ruin. In one corner stands a broken loom.\n\nSix twig blights lurk in the thicket south of this ruin. Allow each character to attempt a Wisdom (Perception) check contested by the blights\u2019 Dexterity (Stealth) check to avoid being surprised by them.\n\nDevelopments\n\nAny loud noises here alert the cultists in area 13, who quietly and cautiously investigate.\n\nAwarding Experience Points\n\nDivide 150 XP equally among the characters if the party destroys the twig blights.\n\n13. Dragon Cultists\n\nA group calling itself the Cult of the Dragon seeks to forge alliances with powerful dragons of the Sword Coast. Toward that end, four cultists recently tracked a green dragon to Thundertree (see area 7) and are waiting for the right moment to approach the dragon and broker an alliance. They have been spying on the dragon from afar, trying to gauge its demeanor and its needs.\n\nThis small farmhouse appears to be just another empty home at first glance. However, all the doors are shut and windows shuttered.\n\nThe doors to this cottage are barred from the inside, requiring a successful DC 20 Strength check to force open. The shutters are also barred from inside and can be forced with a successful DC 15 Strength check.\n\nSix human cultists are hiding in the house. Four stand guard (two in each room) while the others rest in the larger chamber. The cultists wear black cloaks cut to resemble dragon wings, and black leather masks with stylized dragon horns. In addition to the Common tongue, these cultists speak Draconic.\n\nThe interior of the house is dusty and strung with cobwebs. The only furnishings are a small stove, a table, two chairs, and a bunk (which the cultists share).\n\nRoleplaying the Cultists\n\nThe cultists are not interested in fighting anyone and prefer to be left alone. The leader of the group is an evil and ambitious young man named Favric, who hopes to rise through the ranks quickly by earning the allegiance of the green dragon in area 7. His fellow cultists lack Favric\u2019s ambition and flee if he is captured or killed.\n\nIf the characters talk to the cultists, Favric explains that they have come to treat with the green dragon (whose name he doesn\u2019t know). If the characters express a similar desire, Favric suggests an alliance. He really plans to offer the characters to the dragon as part of his tribute, and if a fight ensues, the cultists side with the dragon.\n\nTreasure\n\nIn the main room, Favric has a small coffer containing tribute for the green dragon: three diamonds (100 gp each). He also carries a potion of flying in a stoppered vial around his neck.\n\nAwarding Experience Points\n\nDivide 150 XP equally among the characters if the party\n\ndefeats or drives away the cultists.\n\nWyvern Tor\n\nThis crag is a prominent landmark in the rugged hills northeast of the Sword Mountains, and is easily visible from twenty miles away. People traveling along the Triboar Trail in the vicinity of Conyberry catch glimpses of Wyvern Tor to the south as they go. The tor was formerly the home of a large and dangerous nest of wyverns, but a band of bold adventurers dealt with the monsters years ago. Though the wyverns never returned, other creatures lair here from time to time. Wyvern Tor\u2019s current squatters include a band of ores and their ogre ally.\n\nThe ores are scouts of the Many Arrows tribe. These ores often roam into the more civilized areas of the North, spying out human settlements, waylaying travelers, and looting and plundering as opportunities present themselves. Stories of new settlers near Phandalin and renewed traffic along the old Triboar Trail drew this band to the area. Their leader is Brughor Axe-Biter \u2014 a savage brute who is more interested in murdering and looting than scouting.\n\nOrc Gamp\n\nWyvern Tor is a sizable hill, with miles of rugged terrain on its flanks and slopes. Searching for the hidden orc camp takes time. The party can attempt one DC 15\n\nWisdom (Perception) check or DC 10 Wisdom (Survival) check per hour to find the camp, made by the character leading the way.\n\nWhen the characters find the camp, read the following:\n\nThe faint smell of smoke hangs on the air as you ascend a rugged ridge on the lower slopes of the hill. Fifty yards away, a cave mouth opens up at the bottom of a ravine. Hunkered down by a boulder twenty yards outside the cave, keeping watch, is a single orc.\n\nIf the characters can quietly and expeditiously take out the lone orc, they have a chance to surprise the ores in the cave. If the sentry spots the characters sneaking up, or if it is not silenced during the surprise round, the orc retreats back to the cave to warn the others.\n\nThe marauders in the cave include Brughor Axe- Biter (an orc with 30 hit points), six ordinary ores, and a filthy ogre named Gog. Gog fights until slain, while the ores fight until Brughor is killed, at which point any remaining ores flee.\n\nTreasure\n\nBrughor\u2019s band plundered several homesteads farther north on their way to Wyvern Tor. An unlocked treasure chest in the cave holds 750 cp, 180 sp, 62 ep, 30 gp, and three vials of perfume (10 gp each).\n\nAwarding Experience Points Defeating the monsters at Wyvern Tor completes a quest given to the party by Townmaster Harbin Wester in Phandalin, and it delivers on a promise to Hamun Kost at Old Owl Well. Divide 1,250 XP equally among the characters if the party deals with the ores and the ogre.\n\nCragmaw Castle\n\nThe Cragmaw tribe consists of marauding bands and rival goblinholds scattered throughout the area of the Triboar Trail and the Neverwinter Wood. However, one chieftain is grudgingly recognized by all others as supreme: King Grol of Cragmaw Castle.\n\nCragmaw Castle is not a goblin construction, nor is that the structure\u2019s original name. Raised by a talented wizard-noble of old Phalorm, an ancient realm that once controlled much of the North, the stronghold consists of seven overlapping towers; however, its upper levels have long since collapsed to heaps of crumbling masonry. Only the ground floor is still sound enough to be habitable."

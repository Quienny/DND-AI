Ceilings are 15 feet high unless noted otherwise.\n\nDoors. Interior doors are made of wood reinforced with iron bands. They have neither locks nor keyholes. It takes a successful DC 15 Strength check to break down a door that is barricaded shut.\n\nFloors. Cracked and uneven flagstones conceal a dirt floor underneath.\n\nPART 3: THE SPIDER\u2019S WEB\n\nLight A small amount of natural light filters through the arrow slits around the castle. During the day, this provides dim light in most areas. At night, all areas are dark.\n\nWalls. Exterior walls and load-bearing interior walls are 5 feet thick, with 3 feet of mortared fill sandwiched between 1-foot-thick courses of hard stone blocks. Interior walls are 1 -foot-thick worked stone.\n\nArrow slits in the castle walls are 10 feet above the outside ground level, 4 feet above the interior floor level, 8 inches wide, and 4 feet high. A creature on one side of an arrow slit gains three-quarters cover against attacks from the other side (see \u201cCover\u201d in the rulebook).\n\nL Castle Entrance\n\nThe main gates between areas 1 and 2 are made of bronze-covered wood, but they are corroded and collapsed.\n\nThe castle consists of seven crumbling towers of different sizes and heights, but the upper stories are all in varying states of collapse. A short flight of steps leads up to a terrace in front of the main entryway. Past the wreckage of a pair of sundered doors lies a shadowed hall. Round towers loom over the entranceway, with dark arrow slits looking down on the terrace.\n\nNo monsters dwell here, but the goblin sentries in area 3 are supposed to be keeping watch. They glance only occasionally out of the arrow slits, however, so characters who move quietly might be able to creep past them. Have each character make a Dexterity (Stealth) check. The lowest check is the DC for the goblins\u2019 Wisdom checks to notice the party.\n\nDevelopments\n\nIf the goblins spot the characters (or if the characters approach openly), the goblins shoot arrows from behind the arrow slits. However, they can\u2019t fire directly at enemies at or past the broken gate. The goblins also shout loudly\n\nDisguised Characters\n\nRather than storm Cragmaw Castle with weapons in hand, clever characters might try to talk their way inside. For example, they might don the scarlet cloaks of the Redbrands and claim to be emissaries sent by larno \u201cGlasstaff\u201d Albrek, the Redbrand leader, to meet with King Grol. A good DM rewards this kind of clever thinking by giving the characters a chance to succeed.\n\nIt\u2019s okay if the characters circumvent combat and talk their way past castle defenders. Both the Cragmaw tribe and the Redbrands work for the Black Spider, so the goblinoids aren't likely to attack the party if they claim to be working in the Black Spider\u2019s interest.\n\nIf the characters try to perpetrate a deception as a group, have them each make a Charisma (Deception) check contested by the monsters\u2019 Wisdom (Insight) checks, and give the characters advantage on their checks if the deception is particularly well planned or roleplayed. If at least one character wins the contest, the deception is a success. You may award XP for monsters fooled by the deception. As the party makes its way deeper into the castle, additional checks might be required, at your discretion.\n\n^ ^\n\nenough to alert their comrades in areas 4 and 6 that the castle is under attack.\n\n2. Trapped Hall\n\nOnce the castle\u2019s foyer, this wide hall makes a dangerous battleground.\n\nDoors stand closed to the north and south, with a crumbling mound of rubble partially obscuring the southern hall. To the east, a broad corridor ends in two more doors leading south and east. The corridor is cluttered with dusty rubble and fallen plaster from a partial collapse of the ceiling overhead.\n\nIf the goblin sentries in area 3 raised the alarm, the goblins and hobgoblins in areas 4 and 6 come running out of the north and south doors at the same time. They attack from both directions, trying to overwhelm the adventurers and drive them out of the castle.\n\nTrap. The dusty plaster and rubble in front of the door leading to area 8 conceals a copper tripwire connected to linchpins hidden in the ruined ceiling. Spotting the tripwire requires a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of at least 20, or a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check if characters are actively searching for traps in the area. Once spotted, the tripwire is easily avoided and disarmed (no ability check required).\n\nAny creature that walks over or through the rubble without avoiding the tripwire triggers a cave-in of wooden beams and heavy stones. (The area of the collapse is marked on the map.) Any creature in the area when the trap triggers must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or take 3d6 bludgeoning damage from the falling rubble (half as much damage on a successful save). The noise of the collapse puts the monsters in areas 3, 7, 8, and 9 on alert.\n\nAwarding Experience Points\n\nDivide 100 XP equally among the characters if the party\n\ndetects or survives the trap.\n\n3. Archer Post\n\nCragmaw Castle\u2019s main defenses are its secret location and the appearance of having been abandoned. In addition, King Grol posts sentries to drive off intruders who get too close.\n\nThis small room is littered with debris. The arrow slit opposite the door offers a fine field of fire over the terrace in front of the castle gates.\n\nTwo goblins occupy each of these two rooms. By taking turns shooting arrows and ducking back, both archers can fire each round at targets outside. When characters enter the room, the goblins drop their shortbows and draw their melee weapons.\n\nAwarding Experience Points\n\nDivide 100 XP equally among the characters for each pair\n\nof goblin archers the party defeats.\n\n36\n\nPART 3: THE SPIDER\u2019S WEB\n\nsquare\n\nPc/"

The characters can remain in Phandalin long enough to rest up and purchase supplies. When they\u2019re done, have them pick a storyline to investigate, then set out for the appropriate destination.\n\nTriboar Trail\n\nPhandalin lies in a part of the North known as \u201cthe Triboar Trail,\u201d \u201cthe Triboar Cutoff,\u201d or \u201cthe Cony Gap.\u201d This stretch of foothills and rolling, sparsely wooded plains extends between the Sword Mountains to the south and Neverwinter Wood to the north. The area gains its name from an old trail that runs from the distant town of Triboar to the east, winding westward about one hundred miles through the abandoned village of Conyberry, then running north of Phandalin on its way to the High Road along the coast.\n\nDescribe the party\u2019s overland travels as vividly as you like, but keep the story moving. \u201cYou walk for several miles and encounter nothing of interest\u201d is far less evocative and memorable than, \u201cA light rain dampens the rolling plains as you travel north. Around midday, you break for lunch under a lonely tree. There, the rogue finds a small rock that looks like a grinning face, but otherwise you see nothing out of the ordinary.\u201d\n\nUsing the Overland Map\n\nDuring this part of the adventure, the characters will frequently be marching overland from one point of interest to another. As can be seen on the regional map on page 5, some of these areas are a good forty to fifty miles apart, requiring several days of marching overland to travel to the next adventure site.\n\nTravel Time . Assume that the party travels twenty-four miles per day over a period of ten hours. The characters must rest for eight hours per day, with the remaining six hours consisting of making and breaking camp, preparing meals, and a little bit of foraging or hunting as the opportunity permits.\n\nWilderness Encounters\n\nAsk the players to tell you the party\u2019s marching order, so that you know which characters are in the lead and who\u2019s bringing up the rear. When the party camps, ask which characters are on watch. This information is important if the party encounters something dangerous.\n\nThe Triboar Trail is not safe. As the adventurers travel throughout this area, they might stumble across hungry beasts, greedy bandits, or vicious monsters. Check for encounters once during the day and once at night by rolling a d20. On a roll of 17-20, an encounter takes place. Roll a dl2 and consult the Wilderness Encounters table to determine what the party meets.\n\nWhen an encounter occurs, and the adventurers gain XP if they defeat the monsters. Each creature\u2019s stat block has the XP value for one monster of that sort. Multiply that value by the number of creatures encountered, then divide the total equally among the characters.\n\nWilderness Encounters\n\nDay Roll\n\nNight Roll\n\nResult\n\n1-2\n\n1-3\n\nStirges (1 d8 + 2)\n\n\u2014\n\n4\n\nGhouls (1 d4 + 1)\n\n3-4\n\n\u2014\n\nOgre (1)\n\n5-6\n\n5\n\nGoblins (ld6 + 3)\n\n7-8\n\n6\n\nHobgoblins (1 d4 +\n\n9-10\n\n7-8\n\nOres (ld4 + 2)\n\n11\n\n9-10\n\nWolves (ld4 + 2)\n\n12\n\n11-12\n\nOwlbear (1)\n\nStirges. These flying predators drain the blood of their victims and are drawn to the light of campfires at night. Ghouls . These undead humans hunger for living flesh. Ogre. The ogre is looking for an easy kill. It is too stupid to flee once combat is joined.\n\n27\n\nPART 3: THE SPIDER\u2019S WEB\n\nIf the characters exercise caution and remember what they\u2019ve come for, they will be able to speak with the banshee. When the characters enter the shelter, read the following:\n\nA home of sorts is sheltered within the dome ofwoven branches. It is sparsely furnished with chests, shelves, a table, and a reclined couch, all of it old and of elven craft.\n\nAgatha senses the characters\u2019 intrusion and manifests shortly after they enter her home.\n\nThe air grows cold, and a powerful feeling of dread grips you.\n\nA cold, pale light flickers in the air, rapidly taking on the form of a female elf, her hair and robes waving in a spectral wind. She might have been beautiful once, but a hateful expression twists her features now. \u201cFoolish mortals,\u201d she snarls. \u201cWhat do you want here? Do you not know it is death to seek me out?\u201d\n\nIf the characters are rude, disrespectful, or threatening, Agatha scowls and disappears. She does not attack them, nor does she return if the characters call out to her.\n\nGoblins . The goblins know the location of Cragmaw Castle and can provide directions if they are captured and threatened. Each one carries a pouch containing ldlO cp.\n\nHobgoblins. This squad of hobgoblins is actively seeking the adventurers, hoping to collect on a bounty. They know the location of Cragmaw Castle but won\u2019t provide directions unless they are charmed. One hobgoblin carries a crudely drawn sketch of one party member, with \u201c25 gold pieces for this one\u201d and a symbol of a black spider drawn beneath it.\n\nOres. These scouts are part of the band currently based at Wy vern Tor. As they roam, they look for travelers to ambush or homesteads to burn.\n\nOwlbear. This hungry predator picks up the characters\u2019 scent and pursues them relentlessly.\n\nCONYBERRY AND\n\nAgatha\u2019s Lair\n\nThe town of Conyberry was sacked by barbarians years ago and now lies in ruins. The Triboar Trail runs right through the abandoned town, providing an easy landmark for locating the lair of the banshee Agatha. From the ruins of Conyberry, an old trail leads northwest into Neverwinter Wood. Agatha\u2019s lair is a few miles outside town."

  "content": "As you approach, you see children playing on the town green and townsfolk tending to chores or running errands at shops. Many people look up as you approach, but all return to their business as you go by.\n\nIf Sildar Hallwinter is with the party, add:\n\nSildar seems much more at ease.\n\n\"My friends,\u201d he says, \"let us secure lodgings. I\u2019m told the local inn is very quaint.\u201d\n\nSildar\u2019s plan is to get some rest at the Stonehill Inn, then search Phandalin for signs of the missing wizard, larno Albrek. When his investigation hits a dead end, he sets\n\nup a meeting with Townmaster Harbin Wester (see the \u201cTownmaster\u2019s Hall\u201d section).\n\nDuring this part of the adventure, the characters can visit the various locations in Phandalin and talk to the NPCs there. (See the \u201cTown Description\u201dsection for details.) The town is small enough that it takes only a few minutes to stroll from one end to the other. However, the characters arrive late in the day and can\u2019t get to more than one or two locations before it\u2019s time to seek lodgings for the night.\n\nSome locales the characters should visit include the following:\n\n\u2022 Barthen\u2019s Provisions. If the characters have the wag- onload of supplies from the \u201cMeet Me in Phandalin\u201d adventure hook, they are meant to deliver it to this shop.\n\n\u2022 Lionshield Coster. If the characters retrieved the stolen goods from the Cragmaw hideout, they might want to return them to the rightful owner.\n\n\u2022 Stonehill Inn. If the characters have Sildar Hallwinter with them, the knight suggests heading for this inn to find lodgings. If the characters are otherwise looking for a place to eat and sleep, they discover that the Stonehill appears to be the best available option.\n\nEncounters in Phandalin\n\nWhen the characters explore Phandalin, you don\u2019t need to keep track of how much time is spent at each location. Instead, imagine that you\u2019re directing an old-style western movie. Your goal is to present several scenes in which the adventurers walk into a store or saloon and meet the people there. By interacting with these NPCs, the adventurers learn what the NPCs need or what information they want to share, then can move on to the next location. These scenes are a series of roleplaying encounters that take place over the course of a couple of days of game time.\n\nTo begin, ask the players where they want to go and what they want to do in town. For example, you could tell them, \u201cThere\u2019s an inn, a town hall, a shrine, general stores and trading posts, and a few other homes and businesses. Where do you want to go?\u201d When the players pick a spot, refer to the description in the following section, introduce the NPCs there, and let the interaction begin.\n\nThe Stonehill Inn, If the players aren\u2019t sure what their characters should do, encourage them to begin at the Stonehill Inn. The NPCs there are \u201cpointers\u201d who can direct the characters toward the various adventure opportunities and important rumors that can be found in other parts of the town. By visiting the inn, the characters learn what other places they should visit.\n\n1\n\nl\n\ni\n\n14\n\nPART 2: PHANDALIN\n\nRedbrand Ruffians. Sooner or later, the adventurers run into the thugs who run Phandalin. All you need to do is choose when the ruffians appear. After the characters have had a chance to visit several locations in town and talk to the townsfolk, they might decide to go looking for the Redbrands. When they do, run the \u201cRedbrand Ruffians\" encounter. Alternatively, if the characters are reluctant to seek out the ruffians, the Redbrands can come looking for them at a time of your choosing.\n\nFinding Cragmaw Castle. The characters might want to seek out Cragmaw Castle to find and rescue Gundren Rockseeker. Most of the townsfolk are preoccupied with the Redbrands. and no one in town knows the location of Cragmaw Castle. Qelline Alderleaf, Sildar Hallwinter, and Halia Thornton can offer suggestions on how the party might find someone who knows the location.\n\nImportant NPCs\n\nHere is a quick summary of the most important NPCs in Phandalin. and their relevance to the adventure.\n\nToblen Stonehill Elmar Barthen\n\nDaran Edermath Linene Graywind Halia Thornton Qelline Alderleaf\n\nSister Garaele Harbin Wester Sildar Hallwinter\n\nInnkeeper\n\nOwns a trading post; owes money to the party if you are using the \u201cMeet Me in Phandalin\u201d adventure hook Member of the Order of the Gauntlet with a quest for the party\n\nRuns a trading post and offers a reward for retrieving her supplies Member of the Zhentarim with a quest for the party\n\nHelpful halfling farmer whose son, Carp, knows a secret way into the Redbrands\u2019 hideout\n\nElf cleric of Tymora and Harper agent with a quest for the party\n\nTownmaster of Phandalin with a quest for the party\n\nMember of the Lords\u2019 Alliance with two quests for the party\n\nRoleplaying Phandalin NPCs\n\nIf you\u2019re not sure how to run an NPC, a good way to start is to have the character introduce himself or herself, welcome the adventurers to Phandalin, and ask who they are and what they want. You don\u2019t need to be an actor or stand-up comedian to get good drama or humor out of your NPCs, but if you want to ham it up, here\u2019s some advice:\n\n\u2022 Relax. Don\u2019t worry about impressing your players with your thespian skills (or lack thereof).\n\n\u2022 Get inside the NPCs\u2019 minds. Imagine how they might react to the characters, and strive to be realistic.\n\n\u2022 Mug it up. Scowl, smile, snarl, flutter your eyelashes, pout, cross your eyes, rub your hands together\u2014 what- ever it takes to make your NPCs come to life.\n\n\u2022 Try different voices. Borrow distinctive speech patterns from real life, movies, and television. Adjust the volume as appropriate. An NPC can be loud, soft-spoken, or something in between.\n\n\u2022 Keep the game moving. Let the players steer the inter- actions with the NPCs.\n\nThe characters have no reason to fight ordinary wr.s: :'.k. Hence, no game statistics are provided for them. If statistics become necessary, use the commoner sta: bi : :k to represent an adult NPC of any race.\n\nTown Description\n\nPhandalin is small, so the characters can visit multiple locations and NPCs throughout a given day. If the players choose to have their characters split up, they can cover more ground, but you\u2019ll have to take turns running each interaction for each player. Splitting the party also makes the \u201cRedbrand Ruffians\u201d encounter potentially more dangerous."

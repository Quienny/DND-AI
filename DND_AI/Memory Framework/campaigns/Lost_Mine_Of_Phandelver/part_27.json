Ruined Barracks\n\nThe Cragmaw goblins make use of every bit of available space in the castle.\n\nThe southwest tower of the castle is little more than a heap of rubble. Several ragged bedrolls are scattered across the remaining floor space, and a small, twisting passage leads east through the ruins.\n\nThree goblins bunk here. Though the rubble appears dangerous, the tower is stable, and the eastern passage is safe.\n\nDevelopments\n\nAny loud noises here attract the attention of the goblins in area 7. One goblin comes to investigate the disturbance.\n\nIf it doesn\u2019t return, or if it spots trouble and sounds the alarm, the others investigate.\n\nAwarding Experience Points\n\nDivide 1 50 XP equally among the characters if the party\n\ndefeats these goblins.\n\n5. Storeroom\n\nCaravans raided by the Cragmaws along the High Road and the Triboar Trail supply provisions for the castle.\n\nOld casks of salted meat and sacks of rotting grain fill this storage area. Among the supplies, you see a bloody suit of chain mail, a heavy crossbow, and an unsheathed longsword with the emblem of Neverwinter worked into its hilt.\n\nThough the stores here are not edible by human standards, the goblins can tolerate them when fresher food isn\u2019t available.\n\nOne small cask is filled with an exceptional dwarven brandy, which the goblins overlooked because of its size. The cask contains the equivalent of twenty glasses. A character who imbibes a glass of brandy regains 1 hit point, but a character who drinks two glasses within 1 hour becomes poisoned for 1 hour.\n\nSildar\u2019s Gear. The chain mail and longsword belong to Sildar Hallwinter. Sildar is grateful if at least his longsword is returned to him.\n\n6. Hobgoblin Barracks\n\nThe Cragmaws are a mixed tribe of goblinoids, with a handful of bugbears lording over larger numbers of miserable goblins and a few hobgoblins. The hobgoblins plan to dispose of the bugbears and take over someday, but for now, the bugbears are too strong a threat.\n\nPART 3: THE SPIDER\u2019S WEB\n\nFour plain straw pallets and bedrolls are lined up on the floor of this barracks. Brackets on the walls hold a number of weapons \u2014 spears, swords, morningstars, and more. The north wall shows signs of damage, but the floor is swept clean of rubble.\n\nFour hobgoblins are quartered in this room. Because their goblin neighbors are always getting into fights, they don\u2019t pay attention to noise in areas 2 or 3. However, they are quick to defend their tower if any intruders appear, or to respond to an alarm raised by the goblin sentries.\n\nTreasure\n\nMounted to the walls are five spears, four longswords, three morningstars, two g'reatswords, and a fine quarterstaff. The quarterstaff is engraved with stylized feathers, is surprisingly light (1 lb.), and worth 10 gp.\n\nAwarding Experience Points\n\nDivide 400 XP equally among the characters if the party\n\ndefeats the hobgoblins in this room.\n\n7. Banquet Hall\n\nThe lord of the castle once entertained his guests here, throwing lavish banquets and dances. Now this place is a foul goblin mess hall.\n\nThe western portion of this large hall ends in a wall of rubble, but the remainder is still intact. This must once have been the castle\u2019s banquet hall, with a soaring ceiling twenty-five feet high. Two large wooden tables with plain benches stand in the middle of the room, and a brass brazier full of glowing coals is tucked into one corner. Dirty dishes, half-full stewpots, moldy heels of bread, and gnawed bones cover the tables.\n\nThis hall holds seven miserable goblins and their leader\u2014 a fat, cantankerous goblin with 12 hit points named Yegg. Yegg is the chief cook for the Cragmaws, and he viciously bullies his unwilling assistants as they go about the work of putting food on the tribe\u2019s table. If Yegg is killed, any goblins left alive flee to the east or west, avoiding the north door because of the trap in area 2.\n\nAwarding Experience Points\n\nDivide 400 XP equally among the characters if the party\n\ndefeats the goblins in this room.\n\n8. Dark Hall\n\nEven by day, this area has no exterior light. The boxed text assumes that the characters have darkvision or a light source.\n\nThis high, narrow hall looks as if it might have been part of a chapel or shrine at one time. Angelic figures are sculpted along the room\u2019s upper reaches, looking down on the floor below. To the north, heavy curtains block a matching pair of archways. Between the archways is a cracked but ornately carved stone brazier.\n\nThis chamber contains a grick -the special pet of the goblin Lhupo (area 9). The grick likes to climb up to a ledge hidden in the shadows of the statuary in the higher reaches of the room. It quietly observes intruders that enter the area before dropping down to strike. Compare the grick\u2019s Dexterity (Stealth) check to the characters\u2019 Wisdom (Perception) checks (or their passive scores) to determine who among them is surprised. The grick knows that goblins are not to be eaten unless Lhupo says so.\n\nThe rest of the Cragmaws are terrified of Lhupo\u2019s pet and hurry through this room, preferably in twos or threes.\n\nAny cleric who examines the chapel\u2019s decor can attempt a DC 10 Intelligence (Religion) check to identify the deities that were once revered here: Oghma (god of knowledge), Mystra (goddess of magic), Lathander (god of dawn), and Tymora (goddess of luck). This is an obvious sign that the builders of the castle were human.\n\nDevelopments\n\nIf combat erupts here, the goblins in area 9 cannot be surprised.\n\nTreasure\n\nThe stone brazier contains a mound of coal, buried under which is a gold statuette of a sun elf (100 gp) wrapped in crimson cloth. A goblin hid the figurine here, hoping his fellow goblins wouldn\u2019t steal it from him.\n\nPART 3: THE SPIDER\u2019S WEB\n\nA detect magic spell reveals that the statuette is imbued with divination magic. Any non-evil creature grasping the statue can ask it a question and receive a telepathic response, as though it had cast augury (see the rulebook for a description of this spell). Once a creature has asked its question and received a response, it can never activate the statuette again."

  "content": "Unknown to Sildar, Iarno created the Redbrands, installed himself as their leader, and took the alias Glasstaff to conceal his identity. (The Redbrands call him that because he carries a glass staff.) Once he learns the truth about Iarno, Sildar expresses a desire to have the wizard captured and transported to Neverwinter to face the judgment of a higher authority. Regardless of Iarno\u2019s fate, Sildar rewards the party with 200 gp for eliminating the Rcdbrand threat.\n\nJoining the Lords\u2019 Alliance If the party eliminates the goblin threat from Cragmaw Castle or uncovers Iarno\u2019s treachery, Sildar Hallwinter privately approaches certain members of the group to urge them to join the Lords\u2019 Alliance. He speaks with those who exemplify a desire for the security of civilization through action. If a character agrees, Sildar Hallwinter awards the individual the title of Cloak.\n\nTresendar Manor\n\nMore a castle than a house, Tresendar Manor stands at the east edge of town on a low hillside amid woods and thickets. The ancient manor has long been abandoned, but its cellars have been converted into a Redbrand stronghold. If the characters investigate this place, they find the entrance to the Redbrand hideout.\n\nRedbrand Ruffians\n\nWithin a day or so of the adventurers\u2019 arrival in Phandalin, a confrontation with the Redbrands becomes inevitable. This can happen in a number of different ways:\n\n\u2022 After speaking with a number of NPCs in town, the characters decide to confront the Redbrands at the Sleeping Giant tap house.\n\n\u2022 The characters decide to investigate Tresendar Manor. Skip the encounter and go straight to \u201cRedbrand Hideout.\u201d\n\n\u2022 If the characters show no interest in the Redbrands, a gang of the ruffians seeks them out and picks a fight in street. Run this encounter as the characters are leaving one of the locations in the town.\n\nConfrontation\n\nIf the characters confront the Redbrands at the Sleeping Giant, read:\n\nThe Sleeping Giant is a ramshackle taproom at the east end of town. Four human ruffians linger on the covered porch, perched on empty ale barrels or leaning against the wall. They all wear grimy scarlet cloaks, their sullen stares fixed on you as you approach.\n\nOne of the thugs spits on the ground. \u201cWell, well,\u201d he snarls. \"Here\u2019s a whole pack of little puppies. What do you want, puppies? Come here to bark at us?\u201d\n\nIf the Redbrands confront the characters in the street, read:\n\nAs you head back into the street, you see four armed ruffians waiting for you. All of them are humans wearing grimy red cloaks, their hands on their weapons as they watch you.\n\nOne of the ruffians spits on the ground. \u201cTime for you to move on, strangers. Give us your stuff, and be on your way.\u201d\n\nContinue the insults and baiting as long as you like. The Redbrands attack in a round or two if the characters don\u2019t. Neither side is surprised, because it\u2019s obvious that a fight is brewing.\n\nThe group consists of four Redbrand ruffians. If three of them are defeated, the last one flees toward Tresendar Manor.\n\nDevelopments\n\nRedbrands who are captured or charmed by the characters can impart useful information. (See the \u201cWhat the Redbrands Know\u201d sidebar on page 20.) Townmaster Harbin Wester won\u2019t want to keep Redbrand prisoners until he knows the whole gang has been defeated, but the characters can easily persuade or intimidate him into locking up any prisoners they capture for at least a few days.\n\nIf the characters kill the ruffians, most members of the town are grateful. One exception is the townmaster, who fears Redbrand retaliation. Harbin doesn\u2019t punish the characters but warns them not to cause trouble.\n\nAwarding Experience Points\n\nDivide 400 XP equally among the characters if the party\n\ndefeats the ruffians.\n\nJk k.\n\nDo the Players Need Direction?\n\nAfter the \u201cRedbrand Ruffians\u201d encounter, the players should feel it\u2019s time to deal with the rest of the gang. If they aren\u2019t clear that investigating the Redbrand hideout should be their next move, have one of the NPCs they've already met in town make the suggestion directly and point them toward Tresendar Manor.\n\nIf the players want to follow other leads in the area, it\u2019s okay to move on to part 3 of the adventure and let the ruffians wait. The next time the characters return to Phandalin, make it clear that the Redbrands are causing even more trouble, and that they need to be dealt with.\n\n^ w\n\nPART 2\n\nRedbrand Hideout\n\nThe Redbrands\u2019 base in Phandalin is a dungeon complex under Tresendar Manor. Before the manor was ruined, its cellars served as safe storage for food and water in the event that the estate was attacked, while an adjoining crypt provided a resting place for the deceased members of the Tresendar family. The Redbrands have since expanded the cellars to suit their own purposes, adding slave pens, workshops, and barracks.\n\nIf the characters begin their search at Tresendar Manor, they enter the dungeon in area 1. If they instead follow Carp Alderleaf to the secret tunnel the lad found, they enter the dungeon by way of area 8.\n\nGeneral Features\n\nThe hideout consists of well-built dungeon chambers with flagstone floors and walls of dressed stone blocks. The western end of the complex is lower than the eastern end, with stairs leading down as the characters explore.\n\nCeilings. Passages and chambers are 10 feet high unless otherwise indicated.\n\nDoors. All doors are made of wood with iron handles, hinges, and built-in locks. They are unlocked unless the text states otherwise. larno Albrek (area 12) and a bugbear named Mosk (area 9) each carry an iron key that can lock or unlock every door in the complex.\n\nA locked door can be picked with thieves\u2019 tools and a successful DC 10 Dexterity check. A door can also be broken down with a successful DC 20 Strength check.\n\nSecret Doors. An \u201cS\u201d on the Redbrand Hideout map indicates the location of a secret door.\n\nSecret doors are made of stone and blend in with the surrounding walls. Spotting a secret door from a distance of no more than 10 feet without actively searching for it requires a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 15 or higher, whereas a character who takes the time to search the wall can find the secret door with a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check. Secret doors swing open on hidden iron hinges and are not locked."

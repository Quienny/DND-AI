The journey takes them south along the High Road to the Triboar Trail, which heads east (as shown on the overland map). When they\u2019re a half-day\u2019s march from Phandalin, they run into trouble with goblin raiders from the Cragmaw tribe.\n\nRead the boxed text when you\u2019re ready to start. If you create a different adventure hook, skip to the second paragraph and adjust the details as necessary, ignoring the information about driving the wagon.\n\nIn the city of Neverwinter, a dwarf named Gundren Rockseeker asked you to bring a wagonload of provisions to the rough-and-tumble settlement of Phandalin, a couple of days\u2019 travel southeast of the city. Gundren was clearly excited and more than a little secretive about his reasons for the trip, saying only that he and his brothers had found \u201csomething big,\u201d and that he\u2019d pay you ten gold pieces each for escorting his supplies safely to Barthen's Provisions, a trading post in Phandalin. He then set out ahead of you on horse, along with a warrior escort named Sildar Hallwinter, claiming he needed to arrive early to \u201ctake care of business.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019ve spent the last few days following the High Road south from Neverwinter, and you've just recently veered east along the Triboar Trail. You\u2019ve encountered no trouble so far, but this territory can be dangerous. Bandits and outlaws have been known to lurk along the trail.\n\nBefore continuing with the adventure, take a few minutes to do the following:\n\n\u2022 Encourage the players to introduce their characters to each other if they haven\u2019t done so already.\n\n\u2022 Ask the players to think about how their characters came to know their dwarf patron, Gundren Rockseeker. Let the players concoct their own stories. If a player is hard-pressed to think of anything, suggest something simple. For example, Gundren could be a childhood friend or someone who helped the player\u2019s character get out of a tough scrape. This exercise is a great oppor- tunity for the players to contribute to the adventure\u2019s backstory.\n\n\u2022 Ask the players to give you the party\u2019s marching order and how their characters are traveling. Who\u2019s in front, and who\u2019s bringing up the rear? If the characters are\n\nescorting Gundren\u2019s wagonload of supplies, then one or two characters need to be driving the wagon. The rest of the characters can be riding on the wagon, walking alongside, or scouting ahead, as they like.\n\nDriving the Wagon\n\nAny character can drive a wagon, and no particular skill is necessary. Two oxen pull the wagon. If no one is holding the reins, the oxen stop where they are.\n\nThe wagon is packed full of an assortment of mining supplies and food. This includes a dozen sacks of flour, several casks of salted pork, two kegs of strong ale, shovels, picks, and crowbars (about a dozen each), and five lanterns with a small barrel of oil (about fifty flasks in volume). The total value of the cargo is 100 gp.\n\nWhen you\u2019re ready, continue with the \u201cGoblin Ambush\u201d section.\n\nGoblin Ambush\n\nRead the following boxed text to start the encounter:\n\nYou\u2019ve been on the Triboar Trail for about half a day. As you come around a bend, you spot two dead horses sprawled about fifty feet ahead of you, blocking the path. Each has several black-feathered arrows sticking out of it. The woods press close to the trail here, with a steep embankment and dense thickets on either side.\n\nIf you are using the \u201cMeet Me in Phandalin\u201d adventure hook, then any character who approaches to make a closer investigation can identify the horses as belonging to Gundren Rockseeker and Sildar Hallwinter. They\u2019ve been dead about a day, and it\u2019s clear that arrows killed the horses. When the characters inspect the scene closer, read the following:\n\nThe saddlebags have been looted. Nearby lies an empty leather map case.\n\nFour goblins are hiding in the woods, two on each side of the road. They wait until someone approaches the bodies and then attack.\n\nThis will likely be the first of many combat encounters in the adventure. Here are the steps you should follow to run it effectively:\n\nPART 1 : GOB LI ARROWS\n\n\u2022 Review the goblin stat block in appendix B. Since the goblins are hiding, you\u2019ll need to know their Stealth skill modifier: +6.\n\n\u2022 Check to see who, if anyone, is surprised. The party can- not surprise the goblins, but the goblins might surprise some or all the characters. Make a Dexterity (Stealth) check for the goblins, rolling once for all of them. Roll\n\na d20, add the goblins\u2019 Stealth skill modifier (+6) to the roll, and compare the result to the characters\u2019 passive Wisdom (Perception) scores. Any character whose score is lower than the goblins\u2019 check result is surprised and loses his or her turn during the first round of combat (see \u201cSurprise\u201d in the rulebook).\n\n\u2022 Use the initiative rules in the rulebook to determine who acts first, second, third, and so on. Keep track of every- one\u2019s initiative count in the margins of this book or on a separate piece of paper.\n\n\u2022 When the time comes for the goblins to act, two of them rush forward and make melee attacks while two goblins stand 30 feet away from the party and make ranged attacks. The goblins\u2019 stat block contains the information you need to resolve these attacks. For more information on what the goblins can do on their turn, see chapter 2, \u201cCombat,\u201d in the rulebook.\n\n\u2022 When three goblins are defeated, the last goblin attempts to flee, heading for the goblin trail.\n\nDevelopments\n\nIn the unlikely event that the goblins defeat the adventurers, they leave them unconscious, loot them and the wagon, then head back to the Cragmaw hideout. The characters can continue on to Phandalin, buy new gear at Barthen\u2019s Provisions, return to the ambush site, and find the goblins\u2019 trail."

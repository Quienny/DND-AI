Add:\n\nIn the shadows of the ceiling to the north, you can just make out the dim shape of a rickety bridge of wood and rope crossing over the passage ahead of you. Another passage intersects this one, twenty feet above the floor.\n\nAny character who can see the bridge in area 5 might also notice the goblin guarding the bridge. Doing so requires a Wisdom (Perception) check contested by the goblins Dexterity (Stealth) check result.\n\nThe goblin notices the characters if they carry any light or don\u2019t use stealth as they approach the bridge. The goblin does not attack. Instead, it attempts to sneak away to the east to inform its companions in area 7 to release a flood (see the \u201cFlood!\u201d section of area 5). The goblin moves undetected if its Dexterity (Stealth) check exceeds the passive Wisdom (Perception) score of any character who might notice its movements.\n\nWestern Passage. This passage is choked with rubble and has steep escarpments. Treat the area as difficult terrain (see \u201cDifficult Terrain\u201d in the rulebook).\n\nThe ledge between the two escarpments is fragile. Any weight in excess of 100 pounds loosens the whole mass and sends it tumbling down to the east. Any creature on the ledge when it falls must make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw, taking 2d6 bludgeoning damage on a failure, or half as much damage on a success. The creature also falls prone on a failed save (see \u201cBeing Prone\u201d in the rulebook).\n\n5. Overpass\n\nWhere a high tunnel passes through the larger tunnel cavern below, the goblins have set up a bridge guard post.\n\nThe stream passage continues up beyond another set of uneven steps ahead, bending eastward as it goes. A waterfall sounds out from a larger cavern somewhere ahead of you.\n\nIf the characters didn\u2019t spot the bridge while navigating area 4, they spot it now. Add:\n\nA rickety bridge spans the passage, connecting two tunnels that are 20 feet above the stream.\n\nOne goblin stands watch on the bridge. It is hiding, and characters can spot it by succeeding on a Wisdom (Perception) check contested by the goblin\u2019s Dexterity (Stealth) check. This guard is lazy and inattentive. If no characters are using light sources, each character can attempt a Dexterity (Stealth) check against the goblin\u2019s passive Wisdom (Perception) score to creep by without being noticed.\n\nIf the goblin spots the adventurers, it signals the goblins in area 7 to release a flood (see the \u201cFlood!\u201d section), then throws javelins down at the characters.\n\nBridge. This bridge spans the passage 20 feet above the stream. It\u2019s possible to climb up the cavern walls from the lower passage to the bridge. The 20-foot-high walls are rough but slick with spray, requiring a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check to climb.\n\nThe bridge has an Armor Class (AC) of 5 and 10 hit points. If the bridge is reduced to 0 hit points, it collapses. Creatures on the collapsing bridge must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall, taking 2d6 bludgeoning damage and landing prone (see \u201cBeing Prone\u201d in the rulebook). Those who succeed hold onto the bridge and must climb it to safety.\n\nFlood!\n\nThe large pools in area 7 have collapsible walls that can be yanked out of place to release a surge of water down the main passage of the lair. In the round after the goblins in area 7 are signaled by the lookout in area 5, they start knocking away the supports. In the following round on the goblins\u2019 initiative count, a water surge pours from area 7 down to area 1 .\n\nThe passage is suddenly filled with a mighty roar, as a huge surge of rushing water pours down from above!\n\nThe flood threatens all creatures in the tunnel. (Creatures on the bridge at area 5 are out of danger, as are any characters successfully climbing the cavern walls.) Any creature within 10 feet of the disused passage at area 4 or the steps leading up to area 3 can attempt a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw to avoid being swept away. A creature that fails to get out of the way can attempt a DC 15 Strength saving throw to hold on. On a failed save, the character is knocked prone and washed down to area 1, taking ld6 bludgeoning damage along the way.\n\nThe goblins in area 7 can release a second flood by opening the second pool, but they don\u2019t do this unless the goblin on the bridge tells them to. The goblin on the bridge waits to see if the first flood got rid of all the intruders before calling for the second to be released.\n\n6. Goblin Den\n\nThe Cragmaw raiders stationed in the hideout use this area as a common room and barracks.\n\nThis large cave is divided in half by a ten-foot-high escarpment. A steep natural staircase leads from the lower portion to the upper ledge. The air is hazy with the smoke of a cooking fire, and pungent from the smell of poorly cured hides and unwashed goblins.\n\nSix goblins inhabit this den, and one of them is a leader with 12 hit points. The five ordinary goblins tend the cooking fire in the lower (northern) part of the cave near the entrance passage, while the leader rests in the upper (southern) part of the cave.\n\nSildar Hallwinter, a human warrior, is held prisoner in this chamber. He is securely bound on the southern ledge of the cavern. The goblins have been beating and tormenting him, so he is weak and at 1 hit point.\n\nThe goblin leader, Yeemik, is second-in-command of the whole hideout. If he sees that the characters are getting the upper hand, he grabs Sildar and drags him over to the edge of the upper level. \u201cTruce, or this human dies!\u201d he shouts.\n\nYeemik wants to oust Klarg and become the new boss. If the adventurers agree to parley, Yeemik tries to convince them to kill Klarg in area 8, promising to release Sildar when they bring back the bugbear\u2019s head. Sildar groggily warns the characters that they shouldn\u2019t trust the goblin, and he\u2019s right. If the characters take the deal, Yeemik tries to force them to pay a rich ransom for Sildar even after they complete their part of the bargain."

It contains a complete Dungeons & Dragons adventure, as well as descriptions for every creature and magic item that appears in the adventure. It also introduces the world of the Forgotten Realms, one of the game\u2019s most enduring settings, and it teaches you how to run a D&D game.\n\nThe smaller book that accompanies this one (hereafter called \u201cthe rulebook\u201d) contains the rules you need to adjudicate situations that arise during the adventure.\n\nRunning the Adventure\n\nLost Mine of Phandelver is an adventure for four to five characters of 1st level. During the course of the adventure, the characters will advance to 5th level. The adventure is set a short distance from the city of Neverwinter in the Sword Coast region of the Forgotten Realms setting. The Sword Coast is part of the North\u2014 a vast realm of free settlements surrounded by wilderness and adventure.\n\nYou don\u2019t need to be a Forgotten Realms expert to run the adventure; everything you need to know about the setting is contained in this book.\n\nIf this is your first time running a D&D adventure, read \u201cThe Dungeon Master\u201d section; it will help you better understand your role and responsibilities.\n\nThe \u201cBackground\u201d section tells you everything you need to know to set up the adventure. The \u201cOverview section describes how the adventure is expected to run and gives you a broad sense of what the player characters should be doing at any given time.\n\nThe Dungeon Master\n\nThe Dungeon Master (DM) has a special role in the Dungeons & Dragons game.\n\nThe DM is a referee. When it\u2019s not clear what ought to happen next, the DM decides how to apply the rules and keep the story going.\n\nThe DM is a narrator. The DM sets the pace of the story and presents the various challenges and encounters the players must overcome. The DM is the players\u2019 interface to the D&D world, as well as the one who reads (and sometimes also writes) the adventure and describes what happens in response to the characters\u2019 actions.\n\nThe DM plays monsters. The DM plays the monsters and villains the adventurers battle against, choosing their actions and rolling dice for their attacks. The DM also plays the part of all the other characters the players meet in the course of their adventures, like the prisoner in the goblin lair or the innkeeper in town.\n\nWho should be the DM for your gaming group? Whoever wants to be! The person who has the most drive to pull a\n\ngroup together and start up a game often ends up being the DM by default, but that doesn\u2019t have to be the case.\n\nAlthough the DM controls the monsters and villains in the adventure, the relationship between the players and the DM isn\u2019t adversarial. The DM \u2019s job is to challenge the characters with interesting encounters and tests, keep the game moving, and apply the rules fairly.\n\nThe most important thing to remember about being a good DM is that the rules are a tool to help you have a good time. The rules aren\u2019t in charge. You\u2019re the DM\u2014 you\u2019re in charge of the game. Guide the play experience and the use of the rules so that everybody has fun.\n\nMany players of Dungeons & Dragons find that being the DM is the best part of the game. With the information in this adventure, you\u2019ll be prepared to take on that role for your group.\n\n^ *\n\nRules to Game By\n\nAs the Dungeon Master, you are the final authority when it comes to rules questions or disputes during the game. Here are some guidelines to help you arbitrate issues as they come up.\n\nWhen in doubt, make it up! It\u2019s better to keep the game moving than to get bogged down in the rules.\n\nIt\u2019s not a competition. The DM isn\u2019t competing against the player characters. You\u2019re there to run the monsters, referee the rules, and keep the story moving.\n\nIt's a shared story. It\u2019s the group\u2019s story, so let the players contribute to the outcome through the actions of their characters. Dungeons & Dragons is about imagination and coming together to tell a story as a group. Let the players participate in the storytelling.\n\nBe consistent. If you decide that a rule works a certain way in one session, make sure it works that way the next time it comes into play.\n\nMake sure everyone is involved. Ensure every character has a chance to shine. If some players are reluctant to speak up, remember to ask them what their characters are doing.\n\nBe fair. Use your powers as Dungeon Master only for good. Treat the rules and the players in a fair and impartial manner.\n\nPay attention. Make sure you look around the table occasionally to see if the game is going well. If everyone seems to be having fun, relax and keep going. If the fun is waning, it might be time for a break, or you can try to liven things up.\n\nImprovising Ability Checks\n\nThe adventure often tells you what ability checks characters might try in a certain situation and the Difficulty Class (DC) of those checks. Sometimes adventurers try things that the adventure can\u2019t possibly anticipate. It\u2019s up to you to decide whether their attempts are successful. If it seems like anyone should have an easy time doing it, don\u2019t ask for an ability check; just\n\nintroduction\n\ntell the player what happens. Likewise, if there\u2019s no way anyone could accomplish the task, just tell the player it doesn\u2019t work.\n\nOtherwise, answer these three simple questions:"

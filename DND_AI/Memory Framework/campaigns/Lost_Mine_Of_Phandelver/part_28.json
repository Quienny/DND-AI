Goblin Shrine\n\nGoblins have no use for human gods, so the Cragmaws have rededicated this place to Maglubiyet, the god of goblins and hobgoblins.\n\nThis chamber occupies the northern tower of the castle.\n\nA stone altar stands in the middle of the room, covered with bloodstained black cloth. Golden ritual implements \u2014 a chalice, a knife, and a censer \u2014 are carefully arranged on top of the altar. Two archways to the south are covered with heavy curtains.\n\nThis shrine is home to Lhupo (a goblin with 12 hit points) and two ordinary goblins that serve as his \u201cacolytes.\u201d\n\nThey all wear filthy robes over their armor, but none of them possess divine powers (although Lhupo claims to hear Maglubiyet speaking to him). If the goblins heard the characters fighting the gricks in area 8, they hide behind the altar and attempt to surprise the characters. Otherwise, all three goblins are kneeling before the altar, praying to their evil god.\n\nThe bloodstained cloth completely covers the stone altar, the sides of which are engraved with images of the same gods reflected in the decor found in area 8.\n\nTreasure\n\nThe chalice, knife, and censer are human-made art objects worth 150 gp, 60 gp, and 120 gp, respectively.\n\nAwarding Experience Points\n\nDivide 150 XP equally among the characters if the party\n\ndefeats the goblins.\n\n10. Postern Gate\n\nThis side entrance to the castle is locked but unguarded.\n\nOn the south side of the old castle, an overgrown path leads to a passage that climbs up into the wall. A large iron door stands here, sheltered from direct outside attack. Arrow slits ten feet above the ground overlook the path.\n\nThe iron door is locked. It can be opened with thieves\u2019 tools and a successful DC 15 Dexterity check, or knocked down with a successful DC 25 Strength check.\n\nArrow Slits. Any character who pauses and listens near the arrow slits hears, from area 7, an occasional clatter of crockery and angry goblins arguing over whether the dishes need cleaning. The goblins aren\u2019t keeping watch\n\nfrom these arrow slits. However, if the characters make a lot of noise or commotion, such as knocking down the door, the goblins come and look. If they see intruders outside, they shout an alarm.\n\n1L Ruined Tower\n\nDusty canvas (marked with a \u201cC\u201d on the map) hides the northern entrance to this area, blending in with the surrounding stonework and rubble. A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check spots a footpath leading up to the hidden entrance. If the characters are actively searching the outside of the castle for a hidden entrance, they can make a DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check to spot the canvas \u201cdoor.\u201d\n\nThis tower has almost completely collapsed, although the ground floor still has a little open space. Rotting crates and ancient barrels show that provisions were once stored here.\n\nA heavy curtain blocks a crumbling area to the south, and an intact door leads east. To the north, a short passage through the rubble ends before a screen of canvas.\n\n12. Guard Barracks\n\nThe creatures here keep watch from the arrow slit, so any characters creeping around the east side of the castle are likely to be spotted and attacked.\n\nPART 3: THE SPIDER\u2019S WEB\n\n39\n\nOwLBEAR\n\nA stone brazier full of coals glows in the middle of this small barracks. Four straw pallets are lined up along the east wall. The wall to the south has collapsed, but a barred wooden door in that direction is still clear. A curtain hangs in an archway to the north.\n\nTwo hobgoblins stand guard in this room. They are smart, tough, and loyal to King Grol. At the start of combat, one hobgoblin runs to warn the king in area 14, then returns 2 rounds later to rejoin the fray.\n\nThis area was once a parlor for the castle\u2019s human occupants, though its rotted furnishings were broken up by the Cragmaws and used for firewood.\n\nAwarding Experience Points\n\nDivide 200 XP equally among the characters if the party\n\ndefeats the hobgoblins.\n\n13. Owlbear Tower\n\nThe door to this room is held shut with a heavy wooden bar\u2014 a subtle warning that danger lies beyond. When the bar is lifted, the creature in the room awakens and lets out a terrible roar.\n\nThe arrow slits here are shuttered, leaving the room dark. The boxed text assumes that the characters have darkvision or a light source.\n\nThe upper floors of this tower have collapsed to create a hollow silo at least thirty feet high, and the upper reaches of the room are lost in shadows. Dust, rubble, and broken glass cover the floor, and old worktables and bookshelves lie strewn to the south. In the middle of the room is a hulking beast that looks like a mangy bear with an owl's head. It rears up and roars when it sees you.\n\nThe Cragmaws have captured an owlbear and confined it to this tower. The room is kept dark to keep the beast calm, but King Grol doesn\u2019t know what to do with it yet.\n\nIf a character throws it fresh meat, the owlbear devours the food. Otherwise, it attacks the first creature it sees in the doorway.\n\nThis room was once a library and workshop, but nothing of its original contents remains intact.\n\nDevelopments\n\nIf the characters open the door and stay out of the owlbear\u2019s way, it flees the castle (most likely through area 1 1). The creature attacks anything that gets in its way.\n\nTreasure\n\nAll that remains of the tower\u2019s second floor is a jagged ledge, upon which sits a battered wooden chest. The chest is hard to see from the floor, requiring a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check to notice. The chest is unlocked and contains 90 ep, 120 gp, a potion of healing, a scroll of silence, and a scroll of revivify.\n\nAwarding Experience Points\n\nDivide 700 XP equally among the characters if the party\n\ndefeats the owlbear or releases it.\n\n14-. King\u2019s Quarters\n\nAny character who listens at the door hears two voices in a heated discussion\u2014 a loud, growling voice demanding payment for something, and a silky smooth reply.\n\nThis chamber has been set up as a crude living space, with thick furs thrown on the floor to serve as carpets, old trophies hanging on the walls, a large bed to the north, and a brazier of coals burning brightly. A round table with several chairs stands to the south near the door. Near the table, on the floor, is an unconscious dwarf who looks badly beaten."

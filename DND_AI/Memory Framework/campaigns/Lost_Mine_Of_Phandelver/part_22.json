The characters can enter the\n\nPART 3: THE SPIDER\u2019S WEB\n\nRuins of Thundertree\n\nNear the place where the Neverwinter River emerges from Neverwinter Wood stands the abandoned village of Thundertree. Once, this was a prosperous community on the outskirts of the forest, wealthy from the work of its woodcutters and trappers. Then thirty years ago, the eruption of Mount Hotenow to the north devastated Thundertree. In the wake of the natural disaster, a plague of strange zombies swept over the area, killing or driving off those who survived the eruption.\n\nThough most of the zombies have long since crumbled to dust, strange magic permeating the area has mutated the local vegetation into new and dangerous forms.\n\nFew people dare to venture into the ruined village now, and those who do so seldom stay long\u2014 with two notable exceptions. The druid Reidoth (see area 4) visits Thundertree from time to time, keeping a wary eye on its dangers. Cultists have also arrived recently (see area 13) to treat with a dragon that claims Thundertree as its domain (see area 7).\n\nAs the party approaches the ruins, read the following:\n\nGradually, the trail becomes an old, overgrown lane winding between dilapidated buildings choked in vines and brush. Ahead of you, in the middle of the settlement, rises a steep hill, upon which stands a stone tower with a partially collapsed roof and an adjoining cottage. A dirt road hugs the base of the hill and wends its way between old stone houses, many of which are roofless ruins with interiors open to the weather. Other buildings appear more or less intact. The whole place is eerily silent.\n\nA wooden sign is nailed to a post nearby. It reads:\n\n\"DANGER! Plant monsters AND zombies! Turn back now!\u201d\n\nReidoth placed the sign to discourage bands of treasure seekers from stirring up the monsters in the area.\n\nGeneral Features\n\nMany of Thundertree\u2019s buildings have crumbled in the years since the town was abandoned, even as nature threatens to swallow what remains.\n\nBuildings . A building in Thundertree is either ruined or intact, as shown on the map.\n\nRuined buildings are empty shells with stone walls 5 to 8 feet high. Their roofs are gone, leaving piles of debris inside the walls. The debris is difficult terrain (see \u201cDifficult Terrain\u201d in the rulebook).\n\nIntact buildings are rundown, ramshackle stone cottages that are otherwise still standing. Their wooden doors are swollen and require a successful DC 10 Strength check to force open. The windows of any intact building are 2 feet wide and covered by wooden shutters containing 6-inch wide arrow slits. Creatures on one side of an arrow slit gain three-quarters cover against attacks from the other side (see \u201cCover\u201d in the rulebook). Dusty old furnishings such as simple wooden chairs and tables remain in most intact buildings.\n\nTrees and Brush. Trees average 30 to 40 feet tall and provide cover. Brush consists of large bushes that count as difficult terrain.\n\n1. Westernmost Cottage\n\nThis cottage has seen better days.\n\nCowering in the shadow of an old tree is a crumbled stone cottage with no roof. Weeds are rampant here.\n\nTwo twig blights hide among the weeds that flank the cottage\u2019s open doorway. Make a Dexterity (Stealth) check for the blights, and compare the result to the passive Wisdom (Perception) scores of the characters to determine if the blights are spotted.\n\nThe blights do not attack on their own (except in self- defense) but quickly come to the aid of the twig blights in area 2 if combat erupts there.\n\nAwarding Experience Points\n\nDivide 50 XP equally among the characters if the party\n\ndestroys the twig blights.\n\n2. Blighted Cottages\n\nWind and weather have done their work here, and little remains of these houses or their former contents.\n\nThese ruined, side-by-side cottages look as though they might have been the homes of prosperous shopkeepers or well-off farmers in their time. All that remains are collapsed walls and piles of debris. Several young trees have grown up in the midst of the ruins.\n\nThe overgrowth conceals a deadly threat \u2014 six twig blights lurking among the ordinary foliage. Spotting them requires a successful Wisdom (Perception) check challenged by the blights\u2019 Dexterity (Stealth) check.\n\nThese plant monsters are hungry and fight until destroyed. One round after they attack, the twig blights in area 1 join the fray.\n\nTreasure\n\nA merchant who once lived here had a chest full of coins hidden under the flagstone floor of his home. A thorough search of the interior of the eastern cottage and a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check reveals the old chest among the roots of the tree growing up through the house. The chest contains 700 cp, 160 sp, and 90 gp.\n\nAwarding Experience Points\n\nDivide 50 XP equally among the characters if the party\n\ndestroys these twig blights.\n\n3. The Brown Horse\n\nThis was formerly the Brown Horse, a tavern renowned for its excellent ale.\n\nA weathered signboard by the door of this large building shows the faded image of a workhorse holding a flagon of ale. The building is sagging and dilapidated, but it is more intact than the ruins across the road.\n\nPART 3: THE SPIDER'S WEB\n\nFour ash zombies (see the \u201cAsh Zombies\u201d sidebar) lurk in the shadows in this building, slumped against the walls or under the bar. When living creatures enter, the zombies groan and stir, slowly climbing to their feet (spending half their speed to do so\u2014 see the \u201cBeing Prone\u201d section in the rulebook). They pursue any characters they see, attacking until destroyed.\n\nThe eastern half of the building is the old common room, while the western portion held the kitchens and the brewer\u2019s vats. Huge wooden tuns stand to the west, and a faint smell of yeast still permeates the air. The ale is long gone.\n\nAwarding Experience Points Divide 200 XP equally among the characters if the party destroys the ash zombies.\n\nAsh Zombies\n\nThese zombies were created by the magical devastation when Mount Hotenow erupted thirty years ago. They use the zombie stat block, with the following additional trait."

Their bloated bodies are puckered and blistered, and appear to have been mauled by a large animal.\n\nPART 3: THE SPIDER\u2019S WEB\n\nVenomfang\n\nA young green dragon named Venomfang has recently claimed the tower, having passed over Thundertree while searching Neverwinter Wood for a suitable lair. The giant spider corpses are the former residents of the tower, killed by the dragon after it tore its way through the roof. Since then, Venomfang has been laying low.\n\nTower. The dragon lives in the tower\u2014 a single room with a 40-foot-high ceiling.\n\nA 5-foot-wide staircase circles the interior, rising to the now-opened rooftop that allows the dragon easy access to its new home. Heavy wooden beams and stair supports crisscross the tower interior.\n\nVenomfang does not want to give up such a promising lair, but if the characters reduce the dragon to half its hit points, it climbs to the top of the tower and flies off to fight another day.\n\nCottage. The cottage contains dusty furniture draped in webbing, but nothing of value. If the characters make a lot of noise in the cottage, the dragon hears them and steels itself for a fight.\n\nTreasure\n\nAn old wooden chest broken open on the tower floor holds the last of the dead wizard\u2019s treasure: 800 sp, 150 gp, four silver goblets set with moonstones (60 gp each), a scroll of misty step, and a scroll of lightning bolt. Venomfang spends much of his time greedily admiring the loot.\n\nThe dragon has barely noticed the most interesting item in its hoard. Beneath the coins is a rusty old battleaxe of dwarven manufacture. Runes in Dwarvish on the axe head read, \u201cHew,\u201d and the rust is misleading. Hew is a + 1 battleaxe that deals maximum damage when the wielder hits a plant creature or an object made of wood. The axe\u2019s creator was a dwarf smith who feuded with the dryads of a forest where he cut firewood. Whoever carries the axe feels uneasy whenever he or she travels through a forest.\n\nAwarding Experience Points Divide 2,000 XP equally among the characters if the party drives away Venomfang. Given their level, the characters aren\u2019t likely to slay the dragon, but it is worth 3,900 XP.\n\n8. Old Smithy\n\nThis smithy was abandoned long ago.\n\nA wide chimney and rotted piles of firewood jumbled outside\n\nthe walls of this sagging building suggest that it was a smithy\n\nin its day.\n\nTwo ash zombies (see the \u201cAsh Zombies\u201d sidebar) are slumped on the floor. When the characters enter, the monsters climb to their feet (spending half their speed to do so\u2014 see the \u201cBeing Prone\u201d section in chapter 2 of\n\nthe rulebook). Then they attack. When the zombies have caught sight of the characters, they pursue them no matter where they go.\n\nA variety of old tools\u2014 tongs, bellows, hammers, and a pair of iron anvils\u2014 are scattered around the interior of this building.\n\nAwarding Experience Points\n\nDivide 100 XP equally among the characters if the party\n\ndestroys the ash zombies.\n\n9. Herbalist\u2019s Shop\n\nThis was an herb and alchemy shop belonging to the family of Mirna Dendrar, now a resident in Phandalin (see encounter 5 in the \u201cRedbrand Hideout\u201d section).\n\nThis ruined shop is cluttered with sagging storage shelves and broken furniture. Shards of glass and pieces of pottery glint in the weeds and rubble next to rotted books and casks.\n\nAll the reagents and concoctions here have long since been ruined, and the books are unreadable masses of rot. However, a small wooden case is hidden in a compartment beneath the storage shelves. A character searching through the wreckage can find the case with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check. The check succeeds automatically if Mirna sent the party to find the heirloom.\n\nTreasure\n\nThe case is worthless but contains a gold necklace with a fine emerald pendant (200 gp).\n\nPART 3: THE SPIDER'S WEB\n\nAwarding Experience Points\n\nDivide 200 XP equally among the characters if the party\n\nreturns the necklace to Mirna instead of keeping it.\n\n10. Town Square\n\nEncroaching underbrush has yet to engulf the square.\n\nOn the east side of town, the lane opens up to form a small square. Several ruined buildings surround the south side of the square, but a larger, intact structure to the north looks like a barracks. One lane leads southeast, another heads southwest around the hill in the middle of the town, and a third way meanders north. In the middle of the square, leaning to one side ever so slightly, is a weathered wooden statue of a warrior clutching a spear and shield.\n\nThe leaning statue is ten feet tall, including the base. It depicts an old hero of Neverwinter named Palien, who supposedly defeated several monsters in Neverwinter Wood when Thundertree was first founded. A character who studies the statue recognizes the depiction with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (History) check. The statue can be knocked over with a successful DC 20 Strength check.\n\n11. Old Garrison\n\nFor the residents of Thundertree, living so close to Neverwinter Wood demanded constant vigilance.\n\nThe barracks appears to have weathered the years better than most buildings in town. Its rooftop features a simple battlement, and arrow-slit windows confirm that it was built to serve as a small keep in times of emergency.\n\nFive ash zombies (see the \u201cAsh Zombies\u201d sidebar) lurk within this building. Former members of the garrison, they still wear the remnants of rusted mail and soldiers\u2019 surcoats. These scraps of armor do not improve their Armor Class, however. The zombies animate and attack if any living creature disturbs their rest.\n\nThe interior of the building still contains furnishings, and the main room has a ladder leading through a trapdoor to the roof. The chamber to the north contains two double bunks, while the chamber to the south has three double bunks, providing quarters for ten soldiers altogether. To the northwest of the main area of the barracks was a kitchen and pantry, now containing piles of well-rotted sacks and barrels that once held salted meat. All the foodstuffs have long since been devoured by vermin."

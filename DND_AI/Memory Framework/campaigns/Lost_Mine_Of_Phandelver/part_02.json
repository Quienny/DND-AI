Then determine how hard the task is so that you can set the DC for the check. The higher the DC, the more difficult the task. The easiest way to set a DC is to decide whether the task\u2019s difficulty is easy, moderate, or hard, and use these three DCs:\n\n\u2022 Easy (DC 10). An easy task requires a minimal level of competence or a modicum of luck to accomplish.\n\n\u2022 Moderate (DC 15). A moderate task requires a slightly higher level of competence to accomplish. A character with a combination of natural aptitude and specialized training can accomplish a moderate task more often .than not.\n\n\u2022 Hard (DC 20). Hard tasks include any effort that is beyond the capabilities of most people without aid or exceptional ability. Even with aptitude and training, a character needs some amount of luck\u2014 or a lot of spe- cialized training\u2014 to pull off a hard task.\n\nThe outcome of a successful check is usually easy to determine: the character succeeds at whatever he or she set out to accomplish, within reason. It\u2019s usually equally easy to figure out what happens when a character fails a check: the character simply doesn\u2019t succeed.\n\nGlossary\n\nThe adventure uses terms that might be unfamiliar to you. A few of these terms are described here. For descriptions of rules-specific terms, see the rulebook.\n\nCharacters. This term refers to the adventurers run by the players. They are the protagonists in any D&D adventure. A group of characters or adventurers is called a party.\n\nNonplayer Characters (NPCs). This term refers to characters run by the DM. How an NPC behaves is dictated by the adventure and by the DM.\n\nBoxed Text. At various places, the adventure presents descriptive text that\u2019s meant to be read or paraphrased aloud to players. This read-aloud text is offset in boxes. Boxed text is most commonly used to describe rooms or present bits of scripted dialogue.\n\nStat Block. Any monster or NPC that is likely to be involved in combat requires game statistics so that the DM can run it effectively. These statistics are presented in a format called a statistics block, or stat block. You\u2019ll find the stat blocks needed for this adventure in appendix B.\n\nTenday. In the Forgotten Realms, a week is ten days long and called a tenday. Each month consists of three tendays\u2014 thirty days total.\n\nMagic Items and Monsters\n\nWhenever the text refers to a magic item, its name is presented in italic type. For a description of the item and its magical properties, see appendix A.\n\nSimilarly, whenever the adventure text presents a creature\u2019s name in bold type, that\u2019s a visual cue directing you to the creature\u2019s game statistics in appendix B.\n\nAbbreviations\n\nThe following abbreviations are used in this adventure.\n\nDC = Difficulty Class XP = experience points\n\ngp = gold piece(s) pp = platinum piece(s)\n\nsp = silver piece(s) ep = electrum piece(s)\n\ncp = copper piece(s)\n\nBackground\n\nMore than five hundred years ago, clans of dwarves and gnomes made an agreement known as the Phandelver\u2019s Pact, by which they would share a rich mine in a wondrous cavern known as Wave Echo Cave. In addition to its mineral wealth, the mine contained great magical power.\n\nHuman spellcasters allied themselves with the dwarves and gnomes to channel and bind that energy into a great forge (called the Forge of Spells), where magic items could be crafted. Times were good, and the nearby human town of Phandalin (pronounced &/7-duh-lin) prospered as well.\n\nBut then disaster struck when ores swept through the North and laid waste to all in their path.\n\nA powerful force of ores reinforced by evil mercenary wizards attacked Wave Echo Cave to seize its riches and magic treasures. Human wizards fought alongside their dwarf and gnome allies to defend the Forge of Spells, and the ensuing spell battle destroyed much of the cavern.\n\nFew survived the cave-ins and tremors, and the location of Wave Echo Cave was lost.\n\nFor centuries, rumors of buried riches have attracted treasure seekers and opportunists to the area around Phandalin, but no one has ever succeeded in locating the lost mine. In recent years, people have resettled the area. Phandalin is now a rough-and-tumble frontier town. More important, the Rockseeker brothers\u2014 a trio of dwarves - have discovered the entrance to Wave Echo Cave, and they intend to reopen the mines.\n\nUnfortunately for the Rockseekers, they are not the only ones interested in Wave Echo Cave. A mysterious villain known as the Black Spider controls a network of bandit gangs and goblin tribes in the area, and his agents have followed the Rockseekers to their prize. Now the Black Spider wants Wave Echo Cave for himself, and he is taking steps to make sure no one else knows where it is.\n\nOverview\n\nLost Mine of Phandelver is divided into four parts. In part 1, \u201cGoblin Arrows,\u201d the adventurers are on the road to the town of Phandalin when they stumble into a goblin ambush. They discover that the goblins (who belong to the Cragmaw tribe) have captured their dwarf friend Gundren Rockseeker and his escort, a human warrior named Sildar Hallwinter. The characters must deal with the ambushers and then follow their trail back to the goblins\u2019 hideout.\n\nThey rescue Sildar and learn from him that Gundren and his brothers discovered a famous lost mine. Sildar knows only that Gundren and his map have been taken to somewhere called \u201cCragmaw Castle.\u201d\n\nIn part 2, \u201cPhandalin,\u201d the characters arrive in Phandalin to find it terrorized by the Redbrands, a gang\n\n3\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nof miscreants led by a mysterious figure called Glasstaff.\n\nA number of interesting NPCs can also be found in Phandalin, laying the hooks for short adventures in part 3. The Redbrands try to run the characters out of town, so the characters return the favor and storm the Redbrand lair. In a hidden stronghold beneath an old manor, they find that Iarno \u201cGlasstaff\u201d Albrek, the leader of the Redbrands, is taking his orders from someone called the Black Spider and that the Black Spider wants the adventurers out of the picture."

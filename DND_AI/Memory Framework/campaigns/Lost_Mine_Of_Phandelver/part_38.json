  "content": "Challenge\n\nAn appropriately equipped and well-rested party of four adventurers should be able to defeat a creature that has a challenge rating equal to their level without suffering any casualties.\n\nMonsters that are significantly weaker than lst-level characters have challenge ratings lower than 1.\n\nExperience Points (XP)\n\nThe number of experience points a creature is worth is based on its Challenge. Typically, XP is awarded for defeating the monster.\n\nTraits\n\nTraits are special characteristics of the creature that are likely to be relevant in a combat encounter.\n\nActions\n\nWhen a creature takes its action, it can choose from the options in the \u201cActions\u201d section of its stat block. The rulebook describes other actions available to all creatures.\n\nMelee and Ranged Attacks The most common actions that a creature will take in combat are melee and ranged attacks. These can be spell attacks or weapon attacks, where the \u201cweapon\u201d might be a manufactured item or a natural weapon, such as a claw.\n\nHit. Any damage or other effects that occur as a result of an attack hitting a target are described here. As the DM, you have the option of taking average damage or rolling the damage; for this reason, both the average damage and the die expression are presented. For example, a monster might deal 4 (ld8) slashing damage with its longsword. That notation means you can have the monster deal 4 damage or you can roll ld8 to determine the damage.\n\nReactions\n\nIf a creature can do something unusual with its reaction, that information is contained here. Most creatures do not have special reactions, in which case this section is absent. Reactions are explained in the rulebook.\n\nLimited Usage\n\nSome special abilities\u2014 whether they are traits, actions, or reactions\u2014 have restrictions on the number of times they can be used.\n\nX/Day. The notation \u201cX/Day\u201d means a special ability can be used a certain number of times and that a monster must finish a long rest to regain expended uses. For example, \u201c1/Day\u201d means a special ability can be used once and that the monster must finish a long rest to use it again.\n\nRecharge X-Y. The notation \u201cRecharge X-Y\u201d means a monster can use a special ability once and that the ability then has a random chance of recharging during each subsequent round of combat. At the start of each of the monster\u2019s turns, roll a d6. If the roll is one of the numbers in the recharge notation, the monster regains the use of the special ability. The ability also recharges when the monster finishes a short or long rest.\n\nFor example, \u201cRecharge 6\u201d means a monster can use the special ability once. Then, at the start of the monster\u2019s turn, it regains the use of that ability if it rolls a 6 on a d6.\n\nAPPENDIX B: MONSTERS\n\nMonster Descriptions\n\nThe monsters appearing in the adventure are presented in this section in alphabetical order.\n\nBugbear\n\nMedium humanoid (goblinoid), chaotic evil\n\nArmor Class 16 (hide armor, shield) Hit Points 27 (5d8 + 5)\n\nSpeed 30 ft.\n\nSTR DEX CON INT WIS CHA\n\n15 (+2) 14 (+2) 13 (+1) 8 (-1) 11 (+0) 9 (-1)\n\nSkills Stealth +6, Survival +2 Senses darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 10 Languages Common, Goblin Challenge 1 (200 XP)\n\nBrute.

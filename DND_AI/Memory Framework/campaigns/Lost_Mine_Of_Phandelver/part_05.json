  "content": "The characters might capture one or more goblins by knocking them unconscious instead of killing them. A character can use any melee weapon to knock a goblin unconscious, succeeding if the attack deals enough damage to drop the goblin to 0 hit points. Once it regains consciousness after a few minutes, a captured goblin can be convinced to share what it knows (see the \u201cWhat the Goblins Know\u201d sidebar on page 8). A goblin can also be persuaded to lead the party to the Cragmaw hideout while avoiding traps along the way (see the \u201cGoblin Trail\u201d section).\n\nThe characters might not find the goblin trail, or they could decide to continue to Phandalin. In that case, skip ahead to part 2, \u201cPhandalin.\u201d Elmar Barthen (the owner of Barthen\u2019s Provisions) seeks out the characters and informs them that Gundren Rockseeker never arrived.\n\nHe recounts the goblin troubles and suggests that the characters return to the ambush site to investigate further (after they rest). Barthen also tells the party that Linene Gray wind of the Lionshield Coster (see page 16) can provide more information on the goblin attacks.\n\n^ ^\n\nRests\n\nThe party might need to rest after the goblin ambush, depending on how the battle plays out. See the rulebook for more information on short rests and long rests.\n\n^ -pr\n\nGoblin Trail\n\nAfter the characters defeat the goblins, any inspection of the area reveals that the creatures have been using this place to stage ambushes for some time. A trail hidden behind thickets on the north side of the road leads northwest. A character who succeeds on a DC 10 Wisdom (Survival) check recognizes that about a dozen goblins have come and gone along the trail, as well as signs of two human-sized bodies being hauled away from the ambush site.\n\nThe party can easily steer the wagon away from the road and tie off the oxen while the group pursues the goblins.\n\nThe trail leads five miles northwest and ends at the Cragmaw hideout (see that section). Ask the players to determine the party\u2019s marching order as the characters move down the trail. The order is important, because the goblins have set two traps to thwart pursuers.\n\nSnare. About 10 minutes after heading down the trail, a party on the path encounters a hidden snare. If the characters are searching for traps, the character in the lead spots the trap automatically if his or her passive Wisdom (Perception) score is 12 or higher. Otherwise, the character must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check to notice the trap. If the character fails to notice the trap, he or she triggers the snare and must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, the character is suspended upside down 10 feet above the ground. The character is restrained until 1 or more slashing damage is dealt to the snare\u2019s cord. (See the appendix in the rulebook for the effect of being restrained.) A character who isn\u2019t carefully lowered down takes ld6 bludgeoning damage from the fall.\n\nPit. Another 10 minutes down the trail is a pit the goblins have camouflaged. The pit is 6 feet wide, 10 feet deep, and it triggers when a creature moves across it. The character in the lead spots the hidden pit automatically if his or her passive Wisdom (Perception) score is 15 or higher. Otherwise, the character must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check to spot the hidden pit. If the trap isn\u2019t detected, the lead character must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall in, taking ld6 bludgeoning damage. The pit\u2019s walls are not steep, so no ability check is required to scramble out.\n\nAwarding Experience Points\n\nDefeating the goblin ambushers and finding the Cragmaw hideout completes a story milestone. When the party arrives at the hideout, award each character 75 XP. Make sure the players record this gain on their character sheets.\n\nCragmaw Hideout\n\nThe Cragmaw tribe of goblins has established a hideout from which it can easily harass and plunder traffic moving along the Triboar Trail or the path to Phandalin. The Cragmaw tribe is so named because each member of the tribe sharpens its teeth so they appear fierce and jagged.\n\nThe leader of the Cragmaw bandits lairing here is a bugbear named Klarg, who has orders from the chief of the Cragmaws to plunder any poorly defended caravans or travelers that come this way. A few days ago, a messenger from Cragmaw Castle brought new instructions: Waylay the dwarf Gundren Rockseeker and anyone traveling with him.\n\nPARTI: GOBLIN ARROWS\n\nGeneral Features\n\nThe Cragmaw cave slopes steeply upward. The entrance is at the foot of a good-sized hill, and the caves and passages are inside the hill itself.\n\nCeilings. Most of the caves and passages have steeply sloping ceilings that create stalactite-covered vaults rising 20 to 30 feet above the floor.\n\nLight. Areas 1 and 2 are outside. The rest of the complex is dark unless stated otherwise. The boxed text for those locations assumes that the characters have darkvision or a light source.\n\nRubble. Areas of crumbling rock and gravel are difficult terrain (see \u201cDifficult Terrain\u201d in the rulebook).\n\nSound. The sound of water in the cave muffles noises to any creatures that aren\u2019t listening carefully. Creatures can make a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check to attempt to hear activity in nearby chambers.\n\nStalagmites. These upthrust spires of rock can provide cover (see \u201cCover\u201d in the rulebook).\n\nStream. The stream that flows through the complex is only 2 feet deep, cold, and slow moving, allowing creatures to easily wade through it.\n\nJk ^\n\nWhat the Goblins Know\n\nIf the characters capture or charm any of the goblins here, the\n\ngoblins can be persuaded to divulge some useful information:\n\n\u2022 Fewer than twenty goblins currently dwell in the lair.\n\n\u2022 Their leader is a bugbear named Klarg. He answers to King Grol, chief of the Cragmaw tribe, who dwells in Cragmaw Castle. (The goblins can provide basic directions to Cragmaw Castle. It\u2019s about twenty miles northeast of the Cragmaw hideout, in Neverwinter Wood.)\n\n\u2022 Klarg received a messenger goblin from King Crol a few days ago. The messenger told him that someone named the Black Spider was paying the Cragmaws to watch out for the dwarf Gundren Rockseeker, capture him, and send him and anything he was carrying back to King Grol. Klarg followed his orders. Gundren was ambushed and taken along with his personal effects, including a map."

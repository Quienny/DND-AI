  "content": "Carp\u2019s Story. Qelline\u2019s son, Carp, is a spirited and precocious halfling lad often years. He is enchanted by the idea of being an adventurer and says that he was playing in the woods near Tresendar Manor when he found a secret tunnel in a thicket. A couple of \u201cbig ugly bandits\u201d came out of the tunnel when he was there, and met with a pair of Redbrands. They didn\u2019t see him, but it was close. Carp thinks that the bandits have a secret lair under the old manor house. He can take the characters to the tunnel or provide them with directions to the location. The tunnel leads to area 8 in the Redbrand hideout.\n\nQuest: Reidoth the Druid. Qelline is a longtime friend of a druid named Reidoth. If she figures out that the characters are looking for specific sites in the area, such as Cragmaw Castle or Wave Echo Cave, she suggests that they visit Reidoth and ask for his help, \u201csince there\u2019s not an inch of the land he doesn\u2019t know.\u201d She tells the characters that Reidoth recently set out for the ruins of a town called Thundertree, just west of the Neverwinter Wood. The ruins are about fifty miles northwest of Phandalin, and she provides directions so the characters can easily find the place. If the party pursues this quest, see \u201cRuins of Thundertree\u201d (page 30).\n\nShrine of Luck\n\nPhandalin\u2019s only temple is a small shrine made of stones taken from the nearby ruins. It is dedicated to Tymora, goddess of luck and good fortune.\n\nThe shrine is in the care of a scholarly acolyte named Sister Garaele, a zealous young elf who despairs of ever ridding Phandalin of the Redbrands. Sister Garaele is a member of the Harpers, a scattered network of adventurers and spies who advocate equality and covertly oppose the abuse of power. The Harpers gather information throughout the land to thwart tyrants and any leader, government, or group that grows too strong. They aid the weak, the poor, and the oppressed. Sister Garaele regularly reports to her superiors on events in and around Phandalin.\n\nQuest: The Banshee\u2019s Bargain. Recently, Garaele\u2019s superiors asked her to undertake a delicate mission.\n\nThey wanted her to persuade a banshee named Agatha to answer a question about a spellbook. Garaele sought out Agatha in her lair, but the creature did not appear for her.\n\nGaraele desires an intermediary to bring Agatha a suitable gift, a jeweled silver comb, and persuade the creature to tell what she knows about the location of\n\na spellbook belonging to a legendary mage named Bowgentle. Sister Garaele believes that a character who flatters Agatha\u2019s vanity might be able to trade the comb for an answer. She offers the quest to the characters and offers them three potions of healing as payment for their efforts. If the party pursues this quest, see \u201cConyberry and Agatha\u2019s Lair\u201d (page 28).\n\nJoining the Harpers\n\nIf the party helps Garaele learn the fate of Bowgentle\u2019s spellbook, the elf privately approaches certain members of the group to urge them to join the Harpers. She speaks with those who exemplify the virtues of the network and possess a desire to enact positive change through information and secrecy. If a character agrees, Sister Garaele awards the individual the title of Watcher.\n\nThe Sleeping Giant\n\nThis rundown tap house is a dirty, dangerous watering hole at the end of Phandalin\u2019s main street. It is frequented by Redbrand thugs and operated by a surly female dwarf named Grista. If the characters choose to visit the place, run the \u201cRedbrand Ruffians\u201d encounter.\n\nTownmaster\u2019s Hall\n\nThe townmaster\u2019s hall has sturdy stone walls, a pitched wooden roof, and a bell tower at the back. Posted on a board next to the front door is a notice written in Common. It reads: \u201cREWARD \u2014 Ores near Wyvern Tor! Those of a mind to face the ore menace should inquire within.\u201d The notice bears the town\u2019s seal and an indecipherable signature.\n\nPhandalin has no functioning government, but the townsfolk elect someone to serve as townmaster each year. The townmaster serves as a judge in minor disputes and keeps any records that need to be kept. The current townmaster is a male human banker named Harbin Wester\u2014 a fat, pompous old fool. Completely intimidated by the Redbrands, he claims that they\u2019re \u201cjust a mercenary guild, and not all that much trouble, really.\u201d\n\nThe townmaster\u2019s hall has a small but serviceable jail in the cellar. The jail consists of two cells, and Harbin carries keys to the cell doors.\n\nQuest: Ore Trouble. Harbin is looking for someone to head east on the Triboar Trail, where travelers have reported trouble with a band of ores near Wyvern Tor.\n\nHe offers 100 gp to any group that can take care of the problem. If the party pursues this quest, see \u201cWyvern Tor\u201d (page 35).\n\nQuest: Finding Cragmaw Castle. After resting at the Stonehill Inn, Sildar Hallwinter establishes himself at the townmaster\u2019s hall. As an agent of the Lords\u2019 Alliance, his goal is to bring law and order to Phandalin. As such, he wants to find the lost mine of Wave Echo Cave and help the Rockseeker brothers put it back into production, believing that bringing prosperity to the region will help civilize the town.\n\nSildar also encourages the characters to keep up the pressure on the Cragmaw goblins. He offers the party a 500 gp reward if they can locate Cragmaw Castle and\n\n18\n\nPART 2: PHANDALIN\n\ndefeat or drive off the tribe\u2019s chieftain. Sildar suggests the party might find the castle by searching the lands around the Triboar Trail for more raiding parties (see \u201cWilderness Encounters\u201d in the \u201cTriboar Trail\u201d section of part 3).\n\nQuest: Finding Iarno. After questioning several locals, Sildar learns that larno Albrek, a fellow member of the Lords\u2019 Alliance, disappeared while exploring the area around Tresendar Manor about two months ago, shortly after arriving in Phandalin. Sildar asks the characters to investigate the manor and the surrounding area to find and bring back Iarno\u2014 or what\u2019s left of him, if something killed him. Sildar describes Iarno as \u201ca short, dark- bearded human wizard in his thirties.\u201d"

  "content": "The forest grows dark and still as the trail winds deeper into the trees. Heavy vines and thick layers of moss drape the branches, and the air is noticeably colder than it was in the ruined village. Rounding a bend in the trail, you see a screen made from the warped branches of trees standing close together, woven into a domelike shelter in the shadows. A low doorway leads inside.\n\nDealing with Agatha\n\nIf the characters are respectful and polite, Agatha can be persuaded to help them with a successful DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check. The player whose character takes the lead in speaking with the banshee makes the check. If that player roleplays the encounter well, allow him or her to make the check with advantage. If any character has Sister Garaele\u2019s silver comb and presents it to Agatha as a gift, the check is automatically successful.\n\n28\n\nPART 3: THE SPIDER\u2019S WEB\n\nThe ghostly figure smiles with cold amusement. \u201cVery well,\u201d she says. \u201cI know that you seek many things. Ask me one question, and I will give you an answer.\u201d\n\nIf the characters ask about Bowgentle\u2019s spellbook, Agatha tells them that she traded the book to a necromancer named Tsernoth from the city of Iriaebor more than a hundred years ago. She does not know what became of the book afterward. Her answer is truthful, and it is all the information Sister Garaele needs for the Harpers to resume their search.\n\nThe characters might instead choose to ask Agatha about something else\u2014 for example, the location of Cragmaw Castle, the location of Wave Echo Cave, the identity of the Black Spider, or Hamun Kost\u2019s question about Old Owl Well (see that section). Agatha is well informed and a capable diviner, so she can answer almost any single question pertaining to the adventure that the characters think to ask. However, the banshee answers only one question, so the characters should choose it carefully.\n\nAwarding Experience Points\n\nThe characters gain experience for successfully persuading Agatha to answer a question. If they do, divide 200 XP equally among the characters.\n\nWhere\u2019s the Map?\n\nNo maps are provided for Agatha's lair, Old Owl Well, orWyvern Tor. These adventure locations contain only one or two points of interest, and you don\u2019t need maps to run the encounters effectively. If you feel the need for a map, create your own using the adventure text as a guide.\n\nOld Owl Well\n\nBuilt thousands of years ago by a long-vanished empire, Old Owl Well is a ruined watchtower that now consists of little more than a few crumbling walls and the broken stump of a tower. In the tower\u2019s courtyard stands an old well that still delivers clean, fresh water. Old Owl Well lies in the wild and rugged hills south of the Triboar Trail. The site is relatively easy to find, and any NPC in Phandalin can provide directions to the ruins.\n\nRecently, prospectors in the area have noted that someone has set up a campsite at Old Owl Well, and that undead guardians have been posted to keep intruders out.\n\nAs you crest a low ridge, you spy the crumbling ruins of an old watchtower standing amid the rugged hills. The place is so old that the walls are only mounds of rubble enclosing a courtyard of sorts, adjacent to the broken stump of an old tower. A colorful tent has been set up in the middle of the courtyard, but no one is in sight.\n\nsite from any direction, either following old footpaths or scrambling up the slope and finding a gap in the surrounding walls of rubble.\n\nTwelve zombies lurk inside the crumbled shell of the old watchtower and can\u2019t be seen from outside. However, any character with a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 10 or higher smells a deathly odor wafting from the tower\u2019s direction. When characters approach the tower or the tent, the zombies shamble out of the tower.\n\nIf a battle erupts, Hamun Kost, the evil mage, emerges from his tent and asks, \u201cWhat is the meaning of this?\u201d\n\nKost is a stout, red-robed figure with sallow skin, a shaved scalp, and a black tattoo on his forehead. A character who succeeds on a DC 10 Intelligence (Arcana) check recognizes Kost\u2019s tattoo as a necromantic symbol.\n\nA successful DC 10 Intelligence (History) check verifies the garb as that usual for Thay, a land far to the east where wizards pattern their flesh with tattoos. The tattoo on the head represents a wizard\u2019s school of magic. Kost\u2019s school is necromancy.\n\nIf any character attempts to talk to Kost, even by calling out a greeting or answering his questions during combat, he temporarily calls off his zombies. The Red Wizard is not particularly aggressive, and he is willing to strike a deal that advances his interests at the same time it helps the characters.\n\nKost stays tight-lipped about the reason for his presence in the region. He is, however, willing to provide information the party needs if it does a favor for him. If the characters give Kost some indication of what they want, he shares one or both of these requests:\n\n\u2022 He wants the ores at Wyvern Tor removed, since they have scouted out his camp and seem inclined to cause trouble.\n\n\u2022 He wants to ask a question of Agatha the banshee:\n\n\u201cWhat is the name of the wizard who built the tower at Old Owl Well?\u201d Kost won\u2019t risk the banshee\u2019s anger, but the characters could ask the question for him. (Agatha knows the name: Arthindol.)\n\nTreasure\n\nHamun Kost\u2019s tent contains a comfortable traveling suite, including a cot, a chair, a writing desk, supplies, and a chest of clothes. In the chest is a leather bag containing 35 sp, 20 ep, 20 gp, 5 pp, one pearl (100 gp), a potion of healing, a scroll of darkness in a bone tube, and a tiny jeweled box (25 gp) containing a ring of protection from ancient Netheril, the Red Wizard\u2019s most interesting discovery so far.\n\nAwarding Experience Points Learning about the Red Wizard\u2019s presence at Old Owl Well completes a quest given to the party by Daran Edermath in Phandalin. Divide 200 XP equally among the characters if the party parleys with Hamun Kost and reports back to Daran.\n\nDivide 800 XP equally among the characters if the party defeats Hamun Kost and his zombies."

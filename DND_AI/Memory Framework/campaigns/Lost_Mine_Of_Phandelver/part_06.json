The dwarf\u2019s human companion is being held in the \u201ceating cave\u201d (area 6).\n\nL Cave Mouth\n\nThe trail from the goblin ambush site leads to the entrance of the Cragmaw hideout.\n\nFollowing the goblins\u2019 trail, you come across a large cave in a hillside five miles from the scene of the ambush. A shallow stream flows out of the cave mouth, which is screened by dense briar thickets. A narrow dry path leads into the cave on the right-hand side of the stream.\n\nThe thicket in area 2 is impenetrable from the west side of the stream.\n\nDevelopments\n\nThe goblins in area 2 are supposed to be keeping watch on this area, but they are not paying attention. (Goblins can be lazy that way.) However, if the characters make a lot of noise here\u2014 for example, loudly arguing about what\n\nto do next, setting up a camp, cutting down brush, and so on\u2014 the goblins in area 2 notice and attack them through the thicket, which provides the goblins with three-quarters cover (see the rulebook for rules on cover).\n\n2. Goblin Blind\n\nWhen the characters cross to the east side of the stream, they can see around the screening thickets to area 2. This is a goblin guard post, though the goblins here are bored and inattentive.\n\nOn the east side of the stream flowing from the cave mouth, a small area in the briar thickets has been hollowed out to form a lookout post or blind. Wooden planks flatten out the briars and provide room for guards to lie hidden and watch the area \u2014 including a pair of goblins lurking there right now!\n\nTwo goblins are stationed here. If the goblins notice intruders in area 1, they open fire with their bows, shooting through the thickets and probably catching the characters by surprise. If the goblins don\u2019t notice the adventurers in area 1, they spot them when they splash across the stream, and neither side is surprised.\n\nCharacters moving carefully or scouting ahead might be able to surprise the goblin lookouts. Have each character who moves ahead make a Dexterity (Stealth) check contested by the goblins\u2019 passive Wisdom (Perception) score to avoid being surprised. See the rulebook for more information on ability check contests.\n\nThickets. The thickets around the clearing are difficult terrain, but they aren\u2019t dangerous\u2014 just annoying. They provide half cover to creatures attacking through them. (See \u201cDifficult Terrain\u201d and \u201cCover\u201d in the rulebook for more information.)\n\n3. Kennel\n\nThe Cragmaws keep a kennel of foul-tempered wolves that they are training for battle.\n\nJust inside the cave mouth, a few uneven stone steps lead up to a small, dank chamber on the east side of the passage. The cave narrows to a steep fissure at the far end, and is filled with the stench of animals. Savage snarls and the sounds of rattling chains greet your ears where two wolves are chained up just inside the opening. Each wolf\u2019s chain leads to an iron rod driven into the base of a stalagmite.\n\nThree wolves are confined here. They can\u2019t reach targets standing on the steps, but all three attack any creature except a goblin that moves into the room (see the \u201cDevelopments\u201d section). Goblins in nearby caves ignore the sounds of fighting wolves, since they constantly snap and snarl at each other.\n\nA character who tries to calm the animals can attempt a DC 15 Wisdom (Animal Handling) check. On a success, the wolves allow the character to move throughout the room. If the wolves are given food, the DC drops to 10.\n\nFissure. A narrow opening in the east wall leads to a natural chimney that climbs 30 feet to area 8. At the base of the fissure is rubbish that\u2019s been discarded through\n\nPART 1: GOBLIN ARROWS\n\nthe opening above. A character attempting to ascend or descend the chimney shaft must make a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check. If the check succeeds, the character moves at half speed up or down the shaft, as desired. On a check result of 6-9, the character neither gains nor loses ground; on a result of 5 or less, the character falls and takes ld6 bludgeoning damage per 10 feet fallen, landing prone at the base of the shaft.\n\nDevelopments\n\nIf the wolves are goaded by enemies beyond their reach, they are driven into a frenzy that allows them to yank the iron rod securing their chains out of the floor. Each round that any character remains in sight, the wolves attempt a single DC 15 Strength check. On the first success, they loosen the rod and the DC drops to 10. On a second success, they yank the rod loose, bending it so that their chains are freed.\n\nA goblin or bugbear can use its action to release one wolf from its chain.\n\n4 . Steep Passage\n\nFrom this point on, characters without darkvision will need light to see their surroundings.\n\nThe main passage from the cave mouth climbs steeply upward, the stream plunging and splashing down its west side. In the shadows, a side passage leads west across the other side of the stream.\n\n* ft*.\n\nAdventure Maps\n\nMaps that appear in this adventure are for the DM\u2019s eyes only.\n\nA map not only shows an adventure location in its entirety but also shows secret doors, hidden traps, and other elements the players aren\u2019t meant to see \u2014 hence the need for secrecy.\n\nMaps are best used to show multiroom lairs and other locations that have many places to explore. Therefore, not every location needs a map.\n\nWhen the players arrive at a location marked on a map, you can either rely on a verbal description to give them a clear mental picture of the location, or you can draw what they see on a separate piece of graph paper, copying what\u2019s on your map while omitting details as appropriate.\n\nScale and Grid. A scale allows you to measure distances and dimensions accurately, which is important for combat encounters, magical effects, and light sources, among other things. Indoor maps use grid squares that are either 5 feet on a side or 10 feet on a side.\n\nCompass Rose. A compass rose comes in handy when you\u2019re describing locations. For instance, you might need to tell players about \u201cbarrels along the north wall\u201d or \u201cthe staircase descending to the west.\u201d"

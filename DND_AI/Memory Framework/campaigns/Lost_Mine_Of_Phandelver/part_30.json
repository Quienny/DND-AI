  "content": "Experience Point Awards\n\nIn this part of the adventure, XP is awarded for overcoming monsters, as in parts 2 and 3. However,\n\nXP awards for monsters is not given in the encounter description. Instead, the amount of XP that a monster is worth is noted in its stat block (see appendix B). You calculate the award by totaling the value for each monster the characters overcome. Additional XP awards, and the reasons for them, are described in the text, under the \u201cAwarding Experience Points\u201d heading.\n\nWandering Monsters\n\nMonsters roam through all areas of the mine. Random encounters remind players that monsters aren\u2019t\n\nnecessarily confined to specific areas, and that no part of the dungeon is safe. Encounters with wandering monsters are an effective way to keep the players and characters on their toes, alleviate player boredom, and tax party resources. However, having too many random encounters can become tedious, so use them sparingly.\n\nIf the characters spend a long time in a given area, you can check for wandering monsters by rolling a d20. On a roll of 17-20, an encounter takes place. Conversely, if the players seem restless, you can decide that an encounter occurs. Roll a dl2 and consult the Wandering Monsters table to determine what the party meets.\n\nWandering Monsters\n\nd!2 Roll\n\nResult\n\n1-3\n\nStirges (2d4)\n\n4-5\n\nGhouls (ld4)\n\n6\n\nGricks (ld4)\n\n7-8\n\nBugbears (ld4)\n\n9\n\nSkeletons (ld6)\n\n10\n\nZombies (1 d6)\n\n11-12\n\nOchre Jelly (1)\n\nGeneral Features\n\nThe mine is cold, damp, and surprisingly drafty. A noticeable breeze blows through many of its passages, flowing from area 1 toward area 16.\n\nCeilings . Tunnels are 10 feet high unless noted otherwise. Rooms have 20-foot-high ceilings, while natural caverns have 30-foot-high ceilings dotted with stalactites.\n\nDoors . Unless noted otherwise, all doors are 6 feet tall, 4 feet wide, and made of six-inch-thick cut slabs of stone fitted with iron handles and hinges. The doors are low and wide\u2014 perfect for dwarves.\n\nWalls . The walls are hewn stone. In a few areas (14, 15, 19, and 20), they are dressed with well-fitted stone blocks. Floors. All floors are smooth, natural stone.\n\nLight. None unless otherwise indicated. The boxed text assumes that the characters have light sources or darkvision.\n\nStalagmites. Found in many of the natural caverns, these spires of rock rise up from the floor and can be used for cover (see \u201cCover\u201d in the rulebook).\n\nKeyed Encounters\n\nAll the encounters in this part of the adventure are keyed to the map of Wave Echo Cave.\n\n42\n\nPART 4-: WAVE ECHO CAVE\n\nBarrels\n\nBunk Bed\n\nEscarpment\n\nEungus\n\nStalagmite\n\nTable\n\nWaterwheel\n\nWave Echo Cave\n\n1 square = 10 feet\n\nT3\n\nM\n\n\u00a33.\n\ntana\n\n\u25a0^7\n\n//R\n\n!\n\n_\n\n1 a\n\nS3\n\n\n\n1\n\nI J\n\nr^\\\n\n4\n\ngj\n\nljI\n\n\\ _j\n\ngj\n\n& j \u2014 \\\n\n_\n\n!\n\nr 1 11 i [ 1\n\nBooming Waves\n\nAll good dungeons have characteristics that make them unique, and Wave Echo Cave is no exception. The rhythmic thunder of pounding waves echoes throughout the mine, loud enough to make the stone underfoot shiver. Waves come about two minutes apart, growing louder toward the northeast.\n\nWave Echo Cave is nowhere near the ocean, but a water-filled cavern deep in the mine is connected to an underground hot spring. That spring boils over continuously to produce a surge that slams into a narrow funnel, making a sound like breaking surf. Describe this sound to players on occasion. It wili pique their curiosity and lure them toward its source, drawing them deeper into the mine as a consequence.\n\n1. Gave Entrance\n\nWhether the characters follow Gundren\u2019s map or receive directions to Wave Echo Cave from another source, their initial approach leads them to a narrow tunnel whose entrance is hidden within the Sword Mountain foothills.\n\nThe entrance tunnel leads into a large cavern supported by a natural pillar of rock and containing three stalagmites. In the western part of the cave, behind the column of rock, are three bedrolls and a heap of ordinary supplies \u2014 sacks of flour, bags of salt, casks of salted meat, lanterns, flasks of lamp oil, pickaxes, shovels, and other gear. Amid the supplies, you see the body of a dwarf miner, dead for at least a week.\n\nThe northeastern section of the cavern has collapsed, forming a ten-foot-wide, twenty-foot-deep pit. A sturdy hemp rope is tied off around a nearby stalagmite and dangles down the side of the pit, at the bottom of which is a rough-hewn tunnel heading northwest and east.\n\nThis was the campsite of the Rockseekers. The dead dwarf is Tharden, Gundren\u2019s brother, who was killed by the Black Spider. Gundren\u2019s other brother, Nundro, was here as well and is currently the Black Spider\u2019s prisoner in area 20.\n\nThe dwarves\u2019 supplies are potentially useful, but not particularly valuable.\n\nOpen Pit Climbing up or down the wall of the pit without a rope requires a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check. A character who fails the check by 5 or more falls and takes ld6 bludgeoning damage per 10 feet fallen, landing prone at the bottom. The tunnel at the bottom of the pit leads northwest toward area 2 and east toward area 3.\n\nTreasure\n\nTharden wears a pair of boots of striding and springing. In his haste to explore the rest of Wave Echo Cave, Nezznar overlooked them.\n\n2. Mine Tunnels\n\nThis maze of passages is an old section of Wave Echo Cave\u2019s original mine site.\n\nThis area consists of numerous intersecting passages.\n\nThe ceilings here are only six feet high, and several of the passages end in partially excavated rock faces.\n\nThe dead-end passages are places where the miners gave up and decided to move on to other spots. Patiently lurking in one is an ochre jelly. When the party enters this section of the mine, the jelly begins to stalk the group, instinctively waiting for an opportunity to attack a lone target.\n\n3. Old Entrance\n\nThe tunnel that runs south was the original entrance to Wave Echo Cave, but it was buried by the destruction that wracked the mines centuries ago. A pitched battle was fought here when the ores stormed the mines. The dead still lie where they fell.\n\nMany tunnels intersect at this natural, thirty-foot-high cavern. The walls are carved with simple reliefs showing dwarf and gnome miners hard at work. Below them, nearly two dozen skeletons in rusted scraps of armor are scattered across the cavern floor. Some are dwarf skeletons, while others are ore remains. Haifa dozen large brass lanterns stand in niches or on ledges around the cavern, but none are lit."

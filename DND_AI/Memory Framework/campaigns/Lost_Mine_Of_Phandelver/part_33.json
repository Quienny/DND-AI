  "content": "Mormesk speaks in grave whispers. When the wraith first rises up from the floor, it says, \u201cYour presence is offensive to me, your life forfeit. My treasures are mine alone, not yours to plunder!\u201d If the characters make no attempt to reason with the wraith, it attacks.\n\nIf the characters try to reason with the wraith, it listens to what they have to say, provided they have not harmed it in any way or seized any of its property. The wraith is irrevocably evil, so the only way the characters can stay its spectral hand is to offer it something a former wizard would consider valuable in exchange for their lives. Mormesk values magic items (particularly scrolls), spellbooks, and arcane knowledge. Whatever the gift, a character must succeed on a DC 10 Charisma (Persuasion) check to convince the wraith of its value.\n\nRegardless of what the characters offer it, the wraith won\u2019t relinquish the wooden pipe in the scorched chest.\n\nIt will, however, part with the coins and gems if the characters agree to kill the spectator in the Forge of Spells. (The wraith doesn\u2019t explain what a spectator is. It merely points toward area 15.) Once it receives its gift, the wraith allows characters to peruse its books and keep the secret map in one of them (see the \u201cTreasure\u201d section).\n\nTreasure\n\nThe scorched chest is unlocked and contains 1,100 cp, 160 sp, 50 ep, three diamonds (100 gp each), and a wooden pipe adorned with platinum filigree (150 gp).\n\nA handful of magically preserved tomes remain on the shelves. Most are just histories, but one has a map sewn into its cover. The map\u2019s presence can be discerned with a successful DC 12 Intelligence (Investigation) check. The shows the location of a dungeon of your own creation. When the characters finish their explorations here, this old map can lead them to their next adventure.\n\nPART 4: WAVE ECHO CAVE\n\n47\n\n15. Forge of Spells\n\nHere is where the wizards allied with the dwarves and gnomes of the Phandelver\u2019s Pact channeled the magic of these caverns to enchant dwarven arms and gnome gadgets. The northernmost door is scorched and cracked, its iron hinges partially melted; forcing it open requires a successful DC 15 Strength check. The western double doors are just as damaged but stand slightly ajar.\n\nThis large workshop was badly damaged by the ancient spell battle that laid waste to the mine. Worktables taking up two corners of the room are scorched, and the plaster has been burned off the masonry walls. In the middle of the room, a stone pedestal holds a small brazier in which an eerie green flame dances and crackles. The brazier and its pedestal appear to have been untouched by the forces that destroyed this area.\n\nBehind the brazier of green flame floats a spherical creature measuring roughly four feet in diameter. Four eyestalks protrude from its central mass, two on each side. In the center of the body is a large eye that stares at you.\n\n\u201cHello,\u201d says a thick, burbling voice inside your head.\n\nThe monster that guards this room is a spectator. One of the human wizards who worked in the Forge of Spells summoned the creature to guard the magic items created and stored here. When the mine was sacked, the ores disturbed the delicate magic in the area, unhinging the spectator\u2019s grip on reality. It has become deranged and believes that the mine is still in use, ignoring all evidence to the contrary.\n\nThe wraith (area 14) wants to drive off or kill the spectator, but so far, the creature has easily handled the assaults of Mormesk\u2019s zombies and ghouls while seeing nothing strange about undead roaming the mine. If the party attempts to remove anything from this area, the spectator attacks. If the spectator is blinded somehow, it disappears back to its home plane, convinced that it can no longer perform the task for which it was summoned.\n\nWith a successful DC 15 Charisma (Deception) check, a character can trick the spectator into thinking one or more party members are wizards or miners who work for the owners of Wave Echo Cave, sent to terminate the spectator\u2019s employment. If the deception succeeds, the spectator believes it is released from its obligations, and it disappears and returns to its home plane.\n\nBrazier of Green Flame. A successful DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check identifies the brazier as the source of the magic that suffuses the surrounding caverns. This magic has waned over the years, to the extent that it can no longer be harnessed to permanently enchant magic items. However, any nonmagical weapon or armor bathed in the green flame for at least 1 minute becomes a + 1 weapon or +1 armor, respectively, for ldl2 hours (see appendix A). The brazier cannot be removed from the Forge of Spells.\n\nNorthern Room. This small room is a separate workspace, where items being prepared for enchantment were polished, lacquered, and otherwise finished. Like the main workshop, it has been almost completely destroyed.\n\nTreasure\n\nOn the worktable in the southeast corner of the room are the last items the spectator was charged to protect: Lightbringer and Dragonguard.\n\nLightbringer. This +1 mace was made for a cleric of Lathander, the god of dawn. The head of the mace is shaped like a sunburst and made of solid brass. Named Lightbringer, this weapon glows as bright as a torch when its wielder commands. While glowing, the mace deals an extra ld6 radiant damage to undead creatures.\n\nDragonguard. This +. 1 breastplate has a gold dragon motif worked into its design. Created for a human hero of Neverwinter named Tergon, it grants its wearer advantage on saving throws against the breath weapons of creatures that have the dragon type.\n\n16. Booming Cavern\n\nThe sound of pounding surf that gives Wave Echo Cave its name can be traced to this water-filled cavern.\n\n48\n\nFART 4: WAVE ECHO CAVE\n\nA narrow ledge overlooks a large cavern that houses a surging, seething body of water. The rhythmic booming heard throughout the mines is louder here. At regular intervals, a fresh surge of water funnels into this chamber and slams against the wall just below the ledge. The echo suggests that this cave might be one arm of a much larger cavern to the northeast."

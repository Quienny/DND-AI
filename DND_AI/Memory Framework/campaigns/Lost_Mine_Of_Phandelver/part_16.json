Tresendar Crypts\n\nThe elders of the long-gone Tresendar family were once laid to rest in this mausoleum.\n\nThree large stone sarcophagi stand within this dusty crypt, and propped up against each sarcophagus is a human skeleton clad in bits of rusty mail. False columns along the walls are carved in the image of spreading oak trees.\n\nThe double doors in the southeast corner are sheathed in tarnished copper plate.\n\nThe three skeletons are animated and attack any creature that comes within 10 feet of the door leading to area 5 or the door leading to area 6, unless that creature is wearing the scarlet cloak of the Redbrands or speaks the password \u201cIllefarn\u201d (the name of an ancient elven nation, which once spread across much of the Sword Coast).\n\nThe stone lid of each sarcophagus is carved to depict the person entombed within\u2014 two human males and one human female, all of noble bearing. If opened, the tombs contain mostly moldering bones and scraps of clothing, but see the \u201cTreasure\u201d section.\n\nDevelopments\n\nFighting in this room alerts the Redbrands in area 5 that trouble is on the way.\n\nTreasure\n\nAmid the bones in each sarcophagus is a platinum signet ring (50 gp).\n\nAwarding Experience Points\n\nDivide 1 50 XP equally among the characters if the party\n\ndefeats the skeletons.\n\n5. Slave Pens\n\nFor the past two months, the Redbrands have been capturing travelers in the area and holding them in these pens until they can be sold into slavery.\n\nThis long room is partitioned into three areas, with iron bars walling off the north and south. Filthy straw lines the floors of those cells, the hinged doors of which are secured by chains and padlocks. A pair of disheveled human women are held in the cell to the south, while a human boy is confined to the north. All are dressed in plain gray tunics and have iron collars fitted around their necks.\n\nA heap of discarded clothing is piled carelessly against the far wall.\n\nTwo Redbrand ruffians in scarlet cloaks stand guard here, though they spend most of their time taunting the hapless prisoners (see the \u201cCaptives\u201d section). If they hear fighting in area 5, they take up positions against the wall near the door, then try to surprise intruders. The captives are too intimidated to shout warnings or call for help.\n\nThe heap of clothing belongs to the various captives who have been housed here over the last two months\u2014 at least a dozen people to judge by the size of the pile.\n\nCell Doors . The cell doors feature simple locks requiring thieves\u2019 tools and a successful DC 10 Dexterity check to pick. The doors can also be wrenched open by brute force with a successful DC 22 Strength check.\n\nCaptives\n\nThe three human commoners imprisoned here are Mirna Dendrar and her two teenage children, thirteen-year-old Nars and eighteen-year-old Nilsa. A few days ago, the Redbrands murdered Mima\u2019s husband, Thel, for defying them. (His corpse can be found in area 8.) That night, the gang returned and abducted the family from their home in Phandalin. The gang plans to sell the family into slavery.\n\nThe Dendrars are grateful to the characters for rescuing them, but they can\u2019t provide much information about the Redbrand hideout. All they know is that the boss is a wizard (though they haven\u2019t met him and don\u2019t know his name), and that he has \u201ctall, furry monsters with big ears\u201d (bugbears) working for him.\n\nSide Quest: Mima's Heirloom. Though her family has nothing to offer as a reward, Mirna tells the characters that she might know where a valuable heirloom is hidden. When she was a young girl, she and her family fled from the town of Thundertree after undead overran the place. Her family had an herb and alchemy shop, inside which a case containing an emerald necklace was hidden beneath a section of storage shelves. She never dared to return and retrieve it. The shop was in the southeast part of Thundertree. If the characters decide to explore the ruins of Thundertree, see part 3 of the adventure.\n\nAwarding Experience Points Divide 200 XP equally among the characters if the party defeats the ruffians. Divide 100 XP equally among the characters if the Dendrars make it back to town alive.\n\n6. Armory\n\nThe door to this room is locked from the outside. Across from the locked door is a secret door that leads to area 7. For more information on locked doors and secret doors, see the \u201cGeneral Features\u201d section (page 20).\n\nRacks of weapons line the walls of this chamber, including spears, swords, crossbows, and bolts. A dozen dirty red cloaks hang from hooks by the door.\n\nThe Redbrands have ambitious plans to expand their numbers in the near future, so they have been stockpiling arms and armor.\n\nThe weapon racks hold twelve spears, six shortswords, four longswords, six light crossbows, and eight quivers holding twenty crossbow bolts each.\n\n7. Storeroom and Work Area\n\nIn this chamber, the Redbrands take stock of their stolen wares, either shipping them out through the cavern to the south or packaging them for storage in the stronghold.\n\nPART 2: PHANDALIN\n\nThis area is the north end of a large natural cavern, but it has been finished with dressed stone block walls and a flagstone floor. Several barrels are stored against the walls here, along with a number of empty crates, straw for packing, hammers, pry bars, and nails.\n\nThe cavern continues for some distance to the south. You can make out several passages that open up offthe larger cavern, and what looks like a deep pit or crevasse in the floor.\n\nThis room contains two secret doors, one leading to area 6 and the other to area 12. See the \u201cGeneral Features\u201d section (page 20) for more information on secret doors.\n\nTreasure\n\nMost of the provisions and goods here aren\u2019t valuable, but lying among them are thirty beaver pelts (2 gp each). They were looted from a caravan on the Triboar Trail a few days ago.\n\n8. Crevasse\n\nThe characters arrive here by one of three routes: the tunnel from area 1, the storeroom at area 7, or the rough- hewn passage to the south, which continues off the map for about one hundred feet and emerges from a tunnel in the woods south of Tresendar Manor. The passage is an excellent way to smuggle people or goods in and out of Phandalin without being seen, and is thus perfect for a gang of slavers and thieves."

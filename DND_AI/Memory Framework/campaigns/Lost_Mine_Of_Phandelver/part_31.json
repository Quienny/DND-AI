  "content": "Clinging to the ceiling like bats are ten stirges. The monsters find scant living prey in the mines, and they are ravenous. If the characters are looking down at the skeletons on the floor, the stirges are likely get the drop on them. Any character who isn\u2019t watching the ceiling is surprised unless his or her passive Wisdom (Perception) score is higher than the stirges\u2019 Dexterity (Stealth) check total (roll once for all of them). Characters who aren\u2019t surprised hear a flapping noise as the stirges descend to attack.\n\nThe lanterns and the carvings of miners at work were meant as a welcome to newcomers.\n\n4. Old Guardroom\n\nThis guardroom once protected the nearby entrance to the mine, but it was overrun early in the fighting when the ores attacked.\n\nSplintered stone benches and heaps of rubble from a partially collapsed ceiling fill this room. Amid ruined stone bunks and toppled weapon racks are the bones of several dwarves and ores.\n\nIn the round after any living creature enters this chamber, the bones begin to stir and knit together, forming nine skeletons. They fight until destroyed.\n\n5. Assayers\u2019 Office\n\nThe mine\u2019s assayers worked here, weighing and assessing ore samples and paying the minors for their labor.\n\nPART 4: WAVE ECHO CAVE\n\nThis chamber was once an office or storeroom of some kind.\n\nA large stone counter bisects the room, set with three dusty balance scales made of iron. Cubbyholes carved into the north wall are stuffed with dusty paper scraps. Several long- dead corpses \u2014 gnomes and ores by their look \u2014 are sprawled across the floor.\n\nThe centuries-old paper in the cubbyholes disintegrates if touched, but a character who reads Dwarvish can see faint markings on a few scraps, recording weigh-ins and disbursements.\n\nTreasure\n\nBehind the counter sits a locked iron strongbox, requiring thieves\u2019 tools and a successful DC 20 Dexterity check to open. This pay chest was overlooked in the fighting and contains 600 cp, 180 sp, 90 ep, and 60 gp.\n\n6. South Barracks\n\nThis was a miners\u2019 barracks, where the skilled delvers working in Wave Echo Cave rested between shifts. Any character who listens at the partially open door hears faint crunching and splintering sounds with a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check.\n\nOld stone bunks in orderly rows line the walls of this chamber, and a corroded iron brazier full of old coals stands near the middle of the room. The bones of a half dozen dwarves and ores lie strewn about, clad in scraps of armor. Three gray, hunched figures squat among the remains, pawing at the scraps and gnawing on the bones.\n\nThree ghouls from the pack in area 9 are here, cracking and gnawing on the ancient bones of the fallen in the vain hope that some tasty morsel of marrow remains. The ghouls, eager for a fresh meal, attack immediately.\n\n7. Ruined Storeroom\n\nDespite the destruction all around, the northern part of this storage area has survived intact.\n\nThe eastern wall of this chamber has collapsed into a mass of rubble. To the north, a door stands ajar, leading to a good- sized storeroom. Dusty kegs are tucked neatly against the walls, all of them cracked and split open from age.\n\nIt\u2019s not comfortable, but the storeroom is a secure resting place. No monsters come this way. Moreover, the storeroom door is in good shape and can easily be blocked or barred from the inside.\n\nThe contents of the kegs have long evaporated.\n\n8. Fungi Cavern\n\nThis cave has hindered Nezznar\u2019s explorations. The drow suspects that the mine\u2019s magic workshops are close by, but he\u2019s reluctant to risk dealing with the monsters here.\n\nDense carpets of weird fungi cover large sections of the floor in this cavern. The growth includes puffballs a foot across, weird shelf fungus growing on stalagmites, and large stalks and caps a good five feet tall. Some of the puffballs glow with an eerie green phosphorescence.\n\nMost of the fungi is harmless, and the green-glowing fungi allow creatures to see the entire cavern without the aid of darkvision or a light source.\n\nPoison Gas. Whenever a creature attempts to cross the cavern, the carpets of fungi that cover most of the floor release poisonous gas into the air. Each creature in the cavern must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or take 3d6 poison damage and be poisoned for 10\n\nGhoul\n\nPART 4: WAVE ECHO CAVE\n\nminutes (see the rulebook for more information on the poisoned condition). The gas disperses after 1 minute, but until then, any living creature that ends its turn in the cavern must repeat the saving throw.\n\n9. Great Cavern\n\nThis cave once served as the banquet room, meeting area, and mead hall for the miners.\n\nSteep escarpments divide this large cavern into three sections \u2014 high ledges at either end, and a lower section in the middle. Carved stone stairs climb up to the ledges. Two large tables stand in the middle section, along with a pair of old braziers. A smaller table stands on the eastern ledge. The skeletal remains of dozens of dead warriors \u2014 dwarves, gnomes, ores, and ogres \u2014 attest to the fierceness of the fighting that took place here long ago.\n\nSeven ghouls lurk in the shadows on the western ledge. They notice any light or noise elsewhere in the cave and quickly bound down to attack. The undead are hungry and fight until destroyed.\n\nThe escarpments are 10 feet high and require a successful DC 12 Strength (Athletics) check to climb. A creature that falls or is knocked from the top of a ledge takes ld6 bludgeoning damage and lands prone.\n\n10^ Dark Pool\n\nTreasure is concealed in this water-filled cave.\n\nA still pool fills much of this cavern. The water is dark, revealing little of what might lie within. The shore of the pool consists of a thin layer of broken shells from strange, pale mussels, and a fishy odor hangs in the air.\n\nA passage leads south from this area, and a set of steps climbs up to the east. A sluggish stream flows out of the cave to the northeast.\n\nThe pool is 20 feet deep in the middle. The stream to the northeast is 3 feet deep, and the ceiling of the passage is 2 to 3 feet above the water. Characters can easily wade through the stream to area 18."

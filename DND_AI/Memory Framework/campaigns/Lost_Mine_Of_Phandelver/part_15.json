Most areas are brightly lit by oil lamps in wall sconces, refilled every few hours as needed.\n\nWhat the Redbrands Know\n\nIf the characters charm or successfully question any of the\n\nRedbrands, they can learn the location of their hideout under\n\nTresendar Manor as well as the following useful information:\n\n\u2022 The leader of the Redbrands is a human wizard known as Glasstaff, so named because his magic staff is made of glass. (Only larno Albrek and the Black Spider know Glasstaff\u2019s real name.) Glasstaff\u2019s chambers are in the western end of the stronghold (see areas H and 12).\n\n\u2022 A mysterious figure called the Black Spider has hired the Redbrands to frighten off adventurers and intimidate the locals, for reasons unknown. The Black Spider has sent bugbears to reinforce the Redbrands and provide extra muscle (see area 9).\n\n\u2022 The lower part of the complex is guarded by a hideous \u201ceye monster\u201d (see area 8).\n\n\u2022 The Redbrands have a handful of captives in a holding area \u201cnear the old crypts,\u201d which are guarded by skeletons (see areas 4 and 5).\n\n1. Cellar\n\nAny exploration of the manor grounds finds it deserted, but with plenty of tracks leading to a stone staircase just off the empty ruin of a large kitchen. At the bottom of the stairs stands an unlocked door with a cellar beyond.\n\nWhen the characters open the door, read the following:\n\nThe door opens onto a five-foot-wide landing fifteen feet above a large cellar, with stone steps descending to the floor in two short flights. Another door stands beneath the stairs to the north. A large stone cistern occupies the western part of the room, whose walls are lined with kegs and barrels.\n\nThis room appears to be a large storage cellar, exactly the sort of thing one might expect to find beneath an old manor. The Redbrands want to keep their base of operations hidden, so other than the barrels filled with fresh provisions, nothing in this room gives away their presence.\n\nThe barrels contain salted pork and beef, flour, sugar, apples, and ale. Moving barrels around to thoroughly search them is a noisy activity that attracts the attention of the Redbrands in area 2.\n\nCistern. This rectangular reservoir is clean and filled with cold, fresh water. It is 10 feet deep with a rim 2 feet higher than the surrounding floor (so that the bottom of the cistern is 8 feet below the floor). Drain pipes from the roof of the old manor above fill the cistern with water.\n\nA waterproof satchel hangs from a submerged rope attached along the south wall of the cistern, about 2 feet below the surface of the water. It\u2019s not visible from above the water, but can be found with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check or automatically by a character probing the cistern with a pole or jumping in. The satchel contains some valuable items (see the \u201cTreasure\u201d section).\n\nSecret Door. A secret door is located in the southwest corner of the room. See the \u201cGeneral Features\u201d section for more information on secret doors.\n\nDevelopments\n\nNo monsters or villains are found in this area, but the ruffians in area 2 take notice if the characters make a lot of noise here. They creep into the room, gaining surprise if the characters don\u2019t hear them (see \u201cSurprise\u201d in the rulebook). If the ruffians fight in this area and two are defeated, the last ruffian might reveal the secret door by fleeing in that direction.\n\nTreasure\n\nThe satchel hidden in the cistern is waterproof and contains a potion of healing, a potion of invisibility, 50 gp, and a clean set of ordinary travel clothing. This is a getaway kit that larno keeps here in case of an emergency.\n\n2. Barracks\n\nMost of the Redbrands\u2019 human members have lodgings in Phandalin. This barracks is a good place to lie low after shaking down local miners and fur traders.\n\nPART 2: PHANDALIN\n\nBridge Bunk Bed Locked Door Supplies Rack\n\nSecret Door Sarcophagus Table\n\n100 feet to forest\n\n\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\n\nj\u00a9\n\nB)i\n\nFJ 1\n\n'\n\n\u2022 q\n\nT\u00a3\n\n4 ,\n\nJ\n\nThis appears to be a storeroom pressed into service as living quarters. Two double bunks stand against the wall near the door, while barrels and crates fill the southern half of the chamber.\n\nThree Redbrand ruffians are resting in this room. If they hear a good deal of noise in area 1 (including loud voices or barrels being rolled around), they prepare themselves for a fight and try to surprise intruders.\n\nThe barrels here contain similar provisions to those in area 1.\n\nTreasure\n\nAll three Redbrands wear belt pouches holding treasure. The first holds 16 sp and 7 gp; the second, 12 sp and 5 gp; and the third, 15 ep and two garnets (10 gp each). Additionally, three dirty scarlet cloaks hang from the bunks.\n\nAwarding Experience Points\n\nDivide 300 XP equally among the characters if the party\n\ndefeats the ruffians.\n\n3. Trapped Hall\n\nThis area was part of Tresendar Manor\u2019s original cellars. The Redbrands dug out the dirt beneath the stone floor, creating a hidden pit trap.\n\nThick dust covers the flagstones of this somber hallway. The walls are decorated with faux columns every ten feet, and the double doors at the west end of the hall are sheathed in copper plate, now green with age. A relief carving of a mournful angel graces the doors.\n\nThe pit trap in the middle of the hallway is hidden under a false floor consisting of loose stone tiles laid atop breakaway timbers. The tiles and timbers collapse under 100 or more pounds of weight. A character searching the hall for traps can spot the covered pit with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check. A successful check also reveals narrow ledges on the north and south sides of the pit. A creature attempting to skirt around the pit using one of these ledges must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check.\n\nA creature that triggers the trap or fails the Dexterity check to skirt around the edge of the pit must attempt a DC 1 5 Dexterity saving throw to catch the edge. On a failed save, the creature falls 20 feet to the dirt floor of the pit, taking 2d6 bludgeoning damage and landing prone.\n\nAwarding Experience Points\n\nDivide 100 XP equally among the characters if the party"

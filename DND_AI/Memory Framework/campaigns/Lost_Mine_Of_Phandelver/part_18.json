  "content": "If the bugbears are dispatched, Droop tries to ingratiate himself with the party. He doesn\u2019t remember the route to Cragmaw Castle, but he knows it\u2019s up north, in the forest. He also knows that Cragmaw goblins patrol around Phandalin, and he suggests the characters might be able to capture a patrol to learn more about the castle.\n\nCharacters might be inclined to keep Droop around for a while. See the \u201cNPC Party Members\u201d sidebar (page 11) for advice on how to run Droop as a member of the party.\n\nDevelopments\n\nThe bugbears are the only ones in the Redbrand hideout who know the location of Wave Echo Cave. They won\u2019t willingly divulge this information, since they fear the Black Spider more than they fear the characters.\n\nThe bugbears also know the location of Cragmaw Castle, but again, they don\u2019t share this information readily.\n\nA character who interrogates a captured bugbear can pry the information loose with a successful DC 15 Charisma (Intimidation) check.\n\nTreasure\n\nMosk carries a belt pouch containing 33 sp and wears an eye patch made of black leather set with semiprecious stones (50 gp). He also has an iron key that locks and unlocks all the doors in the Redbrand hideout.\n\nAwarding Experience Points\n\nDivide 600 XP equally among the characters if the party\n\ndefeats the bugbears.\n\n10. Common Room\n\nThis area serves as the headquarters and meeting room for the Redbrands. When there is no official business to discuss, it doubles as a common room where the stronghold guards can relax while off duty.\n\nA character who listens at the door with a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check hears the villains within engaged in a game of knucklebones. This makes for a mysterious rattling sound, followed by shouts and groans and a sudden gabble of voices as wagers are paid. If the characters burst into the room, they automatically surprise its occupants.\n\nSeveral worn tables and chairs are scattered around this large room. Wooden benches are drawn up against walls decorated with draperies of brown and red, and several ale kegs are propped up and tapped.\n\nFour tough-looking human warriors wearing scarlet cloaks are gathered around one of the tables. A stack of coins and trinkets is heaped upon the tabletop between them.\n\nPART 2: PHANDALIN\n\nFour Redbrand ruffians are drinking and playing knucklebones when the characters enter. The game isn\u2019t far from turning acrimonious, as most of them do. The dice are loaded, and the ruffian to which they belong is naturally winning. All four have been drinking heavily, and they are poisoned (see the appendix in the rulebook for the effects of being poisoned).\n\nThe Redbrands immediately recognize characters wearing scarlet cloaks as impostors. However, fast- talking characters might still be able to pass themselves off as \u201cnew recruits,\u201d especially if they offer to join the game. If you don\u2019t think the players are doing a great job roleplaying the deception, you can have the character who is doing most of the talking make a DC 10 Charisma (Deception) check to fool the Redbrands.\n\nTreasure\n\nThe wealth in the room is all on the table, having been bet in the game. (Knocking over the table or mixing up all the enemies\u2019 loot is a great way to distract them for a short time.) The total amounts to 75 cp, 55 sp, 22 ep, 15 gp, and a gold earring set with a tiny ruby (30 gp).\n\nAwarding Experience Points\n\nDivide 400 XP equally among the characters if the party\n\ndefeats the Redbrands in this room.\n\nIarno has left his rat familiar here to watch for intruders. The rat shares a telepathic bond with its master, and it sends a brief warning message to Iarno as soon as it detects intruders. The rat moves at a speed of 20 feet and has AC 10, 1 hit point, and no effective attacks. If the rat is killed, it disappears.\n\nIf the characters leave the rat unharmed, it follows them around as though curious or hungry. It might even feign affection for a character who feeds it, though it remains absolutely loyal to Iarno.\n\nBooks and Notes. Iarno is trying to master the art of brewing potions and concocting alchemical mixtures. The books and notes scattered around the room are basic texts on alchemy. Any character proficient in Arcana can see that Iarno\u2019s apparatus appears to be set up to brew potions of invisibility\u2014 not that he has succeeded so far.\n\nAmong the books is a tome written in Dwarvish. The journal of an adventurer named Urmon, it describes the history of the Lost Mine of Phandelver and the Forge of Spells. (Share the information in the first and second paragraph of the \u201cBackground\u201d section if you have not already done so.) In addition, Urmon records that a magic\n\nmace named Lightbringer was commissioned by priests of Lathander, the god of dawn, from the mages working with the gnomes and dwarves of the Phandelver\u2019s Pact. The mace was lost when Wave Echo Cave and its mine vanished from history. (Characters might find the mace in part 4, \u201cWave Echo Cave.\u201d)\n\nDevelopments\n\nBecause Iarno and his rat familiar share a telepathic bond, the mage (in area 12) knows the characters are coming and has time to prepare for them.\n\nTreasure\n\nMost of the materials in this room have no value, but three small bottles hold rare reagents: mercury, dragon bile, and powdered nightshade. These are worth 25 gp each to an apothecary or alchemist.\n\n12. Glasstaff\u2019s Quarters\n\nIf the characters approach this room through the secret passage from area 7, they can surprise the leader of the Redbrands\u2014 Iarno \u201cGlasstaff\u201d Albrek. Otherwise, his rat familiar warns him of any who approach through area 11, and he flees before the characters arrive.\n\nThe walls of this bedchamber are covered with drapes of scarlet cloth. The furnishings include a small writing desk with matching chair, a comfortable-looking bed, and a wooden chest at the foot of the bed.\n\nIf Iarno is surprised, add the following paragraph:\n\nSitting at the desk is a short, dark-bearded human male in robes, studying a tome. He wears a princely mantle of ermine.\n\nA beautiful glass stafFleans against his chair, within easy reach."

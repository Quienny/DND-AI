  "content": "Sacks and crates of looted provisions are piled up in the south end of this large cave. To the west, the floor slopes toward a narrow opening that descends into darkness. A larger opening leads north down a set of natural stone steps, the roar of falling water echoing from beyond. In the middle of the cavern, the coals of a large fire smolder.\n\nKlarg the bugbear shares this cave with his mangy pet wolf. Ripper, and two goblins. The bugbear is filled with delusions of grandeur and views himself as a mighty warlord just beginning his career of conquest. He is not entirely sane, referring to himself in the third person (\u201cWho dares defy Klarg?\u201d or \u201cKlarg will build a throne\n\nfrom your bones, puny ones!\u201d). The goblins under his command resent his bullying. Fire Pit. The hot coals in the central fire pit deal 1 fire damage to any creature that enters the fire pit, or ld6 fire damage to any creature that falls prone there. A creature can take each type of damage only once per round.\n\nNatural Chimney. A niche in the western wall forms the top of a shaft that descends 30 feet to area 3. See that area for information on climbing the natural chimney.\n\nSupplies. The piles of sacks and crates can provide half cover to any creature fighting or hiding behind them. Most are marked with the image of a blue lion\u2014 the symbol of the Lionshield Coster, a merchant company with a warehouse and trading post in Phandalin. Hidden among the supplies is an unlocked treasure chest belonging to Klarg (see the \u201cTreasure\u201d section). Any character who searches the supplies finds the chest.\n\nDevelopments\n\nIf Klarg is warned by the goblins in area 7 that the hideout is under attack, he and his wolf hide behind stalagmites while the goblins take cover behind the piles of supplies, hoping to ambush the characters when they enter the cave.\n\nIf Klarg and company are not warned about possible attackers, the characters have a good chance to surprise them. The easiest way for the characters to achieve this is to climb the chimney from area 3, since Klarg does not expect an attack from that direction.\n\nIf the wolf is killed, the bugbear attempts to climb down the chimney to area 3 and flee the cave complex.\n\nTreasure\n\nThe captured stores are bulky, and the characters will need a wagon to transport them. If they return the supplies to the Lionshield Coster in Phandalin (see part 2, \u201cPhandalin\u201d), they earn a reward of 50 gp and the friendship of Linene and her company.\n\nIn addition to the stolen provisions, Klarg has a treasure chest that contains 600 cp, 110 sp, two potions of healing, and a jade statuette of a frog with tiny golden orbs for eyes (40 gp). The frog statuette is small enough to fit in a pocket or pouch.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next?\n\nThe next stage of the adventure takes place in Phandalin. The adventurers should have plenty of reasons to visit the town:\n\n\u2022 If the characters began with the \u201cMeet Me in Phandalin\u201d adventure hook, they can be paid by Barthen\u2019s Provisions for delivering the wagonload of supplies.\n\n\u2022 If the characters rescued Sildar Hallwinter, the wounded warrior would appreciate an escort to Phandalin (and will pay 50 gp for the service).\n\n\u2022 Details contained within the characters\u2019 backgrounds might prompt them to seek out specific NPCs in the town.\n\nIt\u2019s also possible that players might decide to do something different, such as striking out in search of Cragmaw Castle (in part 3 of the adventure). If that\u2019s the case, skip ahead to that section.\n\nAwarding Experience Points Exploring the Cragmaw hideout and defeating Klarg and his allies completes a story milestone. Award each character 275 XP. This should provide enough XP for the characters to attain 2nd level.\n\nLevel advancement rules for characters are provided on loose sheets included in this set. Hand these sheets to the players, and allow them to advance their characters to 2nd level before continuing the adventure. Make sure they\u2019ve recorded their XP totals on their character sheets.\n\nIn the next part of the adventure, you\u2019ll award XP differently. The characters will earn experience points based on the monsters and traps they overcome, the NPCs they interact with, and the goals they accomplish.\n\nIf the adventurers come up with a nonviolent way to neutralize the threat that a monster poses, award them experience points as if they had defeated it.\n\n12\n\nPART 1: GOBLIN ARROWS\n\nThe frontier town of Phandalin is built on the ruins of a much older settlement. Hundreds of years ago, the old Phandalin was a thriving human town whose people were firmly allied with the dwarves and gnomes of the Phandelver\u2019s Pact. However, the same ore horde that sacked the mines at Wave Echo Cave laid waste to the settlement, and Phandalin was abandoned for centuries.\n\nIn the last three or four years, hardy settlers from the cities of Neverwinter and Waterdeep have begun the hard work of reclaiming the ruins of Phandalin. A bustling frontier settlement has grown up on the site of the old town, and is home now to farmers, woodcutters, fur traders, and prospectors drawn by stories of gold and platinum in the foothills of the Sword Mountains. Unfortunately, more than a few bandits and brigands have settled here as well, taking advantage of the fact that the area has no local lord or authority to chase them off. A gang known as the Redbrands has controlled Phandalin for the past two months, extorting and bullying everyone in town. The gang is led by a mysterious figure known to the townsfolk as Glasstaff.\n\nWhen the characters first arrive in Phandalin, read:\n\nThe rutted track emerges from a wooded hillside, and you catch your first glimpse of Phandalin. The town consists of forty or fifty simple log buildings, some built on old fieldstone foundations. More old ruins \u2014 crumbling stone walls covered in ivy and briars \u2014 surround the newer houses and shops, showing how this must have been a much larger town in centuries past. Most of the newer buildings are set on the sides of the cart track, which widens into a muddy main street of sorts as it climbs toward a ruined manor house on a hillside at the east side of town."

The first time the zombie takes damage, any living creature within 5 feet of the zombie must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or gain disadvantage on attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on it early with a successful save.\n\n4. Druid\u2019s Watch\n\nWhen Reidoth visits Thundertree, this is where he makes camp.\n\nThis small house appears to be in better condition than the ruined and dilapidated structures nearby. The doors are reinforced with heavy iron bands, and thick shutters protect the windows.\n\nReidoth is a gaunt, white-bearded human who doesn\u2019t use two words when one word will do. Though he receives very few visitors, he is reasonably hospitable.\n\nReidoth is adept at staying away from the ash zombies that overrun the village, as well as avoiding the area\u2019s mutated plants. He knows that dangerous spiders lurk in the ruins at the base of the hill, and he suspects that someone is hiding out on the eastern side of town\u2014 he\u2019s seen \u201cfolk in black masks and cloaks\u201d (the cultists) skulking around. However, he is currently most concerned by the fact that a green dragon has moved into the tower (area 7) since the last time he was here. He warns the characters of all these threats, and suggests that they leave Thundertree before they get themselves killed.\n\n31\n\nPART 3: THE SPIDER\u2019S WEB\n\nDevelopments\n\nIf the characters ask about Cragmaw Castle, Reidoth gladly provides directions. He is a member of the Emerald Enclave, a widespread group of wilderness survivalists who preserve the natural order while rooting out troublesome threats. The enclave works to restore and preserve the natural order by keeping the elemental forces of the world in check, preventing civilization and the wilderness from destroying one another, and helping others survive the perils of the wilds. The goblins are a threat to the delicate balance.\n\nIf the characters ask Reidoth about Wave Echo Cave, he will not divulge its location but will offer to guide the party there in exchange for a favor: he wants them to chase off the dragon in area 7. If they succeed, Reidoth will honor his part of the agreement but will not accompany the party inside the mine.\n\nIf the characters attack him for any reason, Reidoth transforms into a gray squirrel and scurries out of the cottage through a crack in the wall. He vanishes into the woods, then waits for the hostile characters to leave. His watch post contains nothing of value.\n\nJoining the Emerald Enclave If the party helps Reidoth by chasing off Venomfang, the druid privately approaches certain members of the group and urges them to join the Emerald Enclave. He speaks with those who exemplify the ideal of protecting the natural order. If a character agrees, Reidoth gives the individual the title of Springwarden.\n\n5. Blighted Farmhouse\n\nTo its south, this farm abuts a field with thick patches of gorse and briars.\n\nThis ruin looks as if it might once have been a farmhouse.\n\nIt is now half swallowed by a dense thicket, with trees growing up through its ruined foundations. The lane continues south a short distance past the ruin before ending in an overgrown field.\n\nThe thicket east of this ruin is crawling with eight twig blights. Any disturbance in the ruined farmhouse (for example, characters rooting around in the rubble) draws the blights\u2019 ire.\n\nEach round for 3 rounds, two twig blights head for the south doorway leading into the farmhouse while two more head for the north doorway. The blights attack until destroyed.\n\nAwarding Experience Points\n\nDivide 200 XP equally among the characters if the party\n\ndestroys the twig blights.\n\n6. Ruined Store\n\nThis former general store is not a complete ruin yet, with portions of its tile roof still intact.\n\nAt an intersection near the middle of the village, a narrow lane winds up the steep hillside to the north. Directly to the south is a ruined building that might have been a store or workshop. Webs stretch across the lane, from the building to the trees on the north side of the road.\n\nTwo giant spiders hide on the inner walls in this ruined building, so they are not visible from outside. Trailing lines from the webs in the lane allow the spiders to sense when prey is moving through the webs, at which point they nimbly scuttle over the wall and attack. The alert spiders surprise any character whose passive Wisdom (Perception) score is less than 17.\n\nWebs . The webs fill two squares north of the doorway (and the square marked \u201c6\u201d). They are difficult terrain, and a creature trying to move through them must succeed on a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check. On a failure, the creature is restrained in the webs (see the rulebook for the effects of being restrained). A snared creature can take an action each round to attempt to break free with a DC 12 Strength check, or it can try to cut its way free by using a light weapon that deals slashing damage. The webs have AC 10, 5 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to bludgeoning, poison, and psychic damage (see \u201cDamage Resistance and Vulnerability\u201d in the rulebook for how vulnerability works).\n\nGoing around the webs is difficult because of the thickets on the north side of the road. Going around the ruined building to the south leads to the twig blights in area 5.\n\nTreasure\n\nThe corpse of an unfortunate adventurer is cocooned in spider silk in the western half of the building. The body is shriveled up and sucked dry, but appears to have been a male elf. The body wears studded leather armor and a shortsword in the scabbard at its hip. A careful search also yields a potion of healing in a belt pouch, along with 23 gp and 35 sp.\n\nAwarding Experience Points\n\nDivide 400 XP equally among the characters if the party defeats the giant spiders.\n\n7. Dragon\u2019s Tower\n\nThis tower was formerly the home of a human wizard, who was killed fighting the ash zombies that overran Thundertree thirty years ago.\n\nAt the top of the hill stands a round tower with a cottage attached. Both are in good condition, although half ofthe tower\u2019s roof is gone. A door leads into the cottage, and several arrow-slit windows are visible in the tower. You can\u2019t help but notice an eerie quiet in the area and a strange, acrid smell in the air."

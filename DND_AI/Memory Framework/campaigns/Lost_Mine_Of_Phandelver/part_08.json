Sildar takes ld6 bludgeoning damage from the fall, which is enough to drop him to 0 hit points. Quick-acting characters can try to stabilize him before he dies (see \u201cDamage, Healing, and Dying\u201d in the rulebook).\n\nRoleplaying Sildar\n\nSildar Hallwinter is a kindhearted human male of nearly fifty years who holds a place of honor in the famous griffon cavalry of the great city of Waterdeep. He is an agent of the Lords\u2019 Alliance, a group of allied political powers concerned with mutual security and prosperity. Members of the order ensure the safety of cities and other settlements by proactively eliminating threats by any means, while bringing honor and glory to their leaders and homelands.\n\nSildar met Gundren Rockseeker in Neverwinter and agreed to accompany him back to Phandalin. Sildar wants to investigate the fate of Iarno Albrek, a human wizard and fellow member of the Lords\u2019 Alliance who disappeared shortly after arriving in Phandalin. Sildar hopes to learn what happened to Iarno, assist Gundren in reopening the old mine, and help restore Phandalin to a civilized center of wealth and prosperity.\n\nSildar provides the characters with four pieces of useful information:\n\n\u2022 The three Rockseeker brothers (Gundren, Tharden, and Nundro) recently located an entrance to the long-lost Wave Echo Cave, site of the mines of the Phandelver\u2019s Pact. (Share the information in the first two paragraphs of the \u201cBackground\u201d section to the players at this time.)\n\n\u2022 Ktarg, the bugbear who leads this goblin band, had orders to waylay Gundren. Sildar heard from the goblins that the Black Spider sent word that the dwarf was to be brought to him. Sildar doesn\u2019t know who or what the Black Spider is.\n\n\u2022 Gundren had a map showing the secret location of Wave Echo Cave, but the goblins took it when they captured him. Sildar believes that Klarg sent the map and the dwarf to the chief of the Cragmaws at a place called Cragmaw Castle. Sildar doesn\u2019t know where that might be, but he suggests someone in Phandalin might know. (It doesn\u2019t occur to Sildar immediately, but a captured goblin might also be persuaded to divulge the castle\u2019s location. See the \u201cWhat the Goblins Know\u201d sidebar on page 8.)\n\n\u2022 Sildar\u2019s contact in Phandalin is a human wizard named Iarno Albrek. The wizard traveled to the town two months ago to establish order there. After the Lords\u2019 Alliance received no word from Iarno, Sildar decided to investigate.\n\nSildar tells the characters that he intends to continue on to Phandalin, since it\u2019s the nearest settlement. He offers to pay the party 50 gp to provide escort. Although he has no money on him, Sildar can secure a loan to pay the characters within a day after arriving in Phandalin. First, he hopes they\u2019ll put a stop to the goblin raids by clearing out the caves.\n\nDevelopments\n\nIf he is rescued and healed, Sildar Hallwinter remains with the party but is anxious to reach Phandalin as quickly as possible. He doesn\u2019t have any weapons or armor, but he can take a shortsword from a defeated goblin or use a weapon loaned to him by a character.\n\nIf Sildar joins the party, see the \u201cNPC Party Members\u201d sidebar for tips on how to run him.\n\nTreasure\n\nYeemik carries a pouch containing three gold teeth (1 gp each) and 15 sp. Sildar\u2019s gear, along with Gundren Rockseeker, was taken to Cragmaw Castle.\n\nNPC Party Members\n\nAn NPC might join the party, if only for a short time. Here are some tips to help you run an NPC party member:\n\n\u2022 Let the characters make the important decisions. They are the protagonists of the adventure. If the characters ask an NPC party member for advice or direction, remember that NPCs make mistakes too.\n\n\u2022 An NPC won\u2019t deliberately put himself or herself in harm\u2019s way unless there\u2019s a good reason to do so.\n\n\u2022 An NPC won\u2019t treat all party members the same way, which can create some fun friction. As an NPC gets to know the characters, think about which characters the NPC likes most and which ones the NPC likes least, and let those likes and dislikes affect how the NPC interacts with the party members.\n\n\u2022 In a combat encounter, keep the NPC\u2019s actions simple and straightforward. Also, look for things that the NPC can do besides fighting. For example, an NPC might stabilize a dying character, guard a prisoner, or help barricade a door.\n\n\u2022 If an NPC contributes greatly to the party\u2019s success in a battle, the NPC should receive an equal share of the XP earned for the encounter. (The characters receive less XP as a consequence.)\n\n\u2022 NPCs have their own lives and goals. Consequently, an NPC should remain with the party only as long as doing so makes sense for those goals.\n\n^ W\n\n7. Twin Pools Cave _ ___\n\nIf the goblins have drained either pool to flood the passage, adjust the following boxed text accordingly.\n\nThis cavern is half filled with two large pools of water. A narrow waterfall high in the eastern wall feeds the pool, which drains out the western end of the chamber to form the stream that flows out of the cave mouth below. Low fieldstone walls serve as dams holding the water in. A wide exit stands to the south, while two smaller passages lead west. The sound of the waterfall echoes through the cavern, making it difficult to hear.\n\nThree goblins guard this cave. If the goblin in area 5 spotted the characters and warned the goblins here, they are ready for trouble. The noise of the waterfall means that the creatures in area 8 can\u2019t hear any fighting that takes place here, and vice versa. Therefore, as soon as a fight breaks out here, one goblin flees to area 8 to warn Klarg.\n\nPART 1 : GOBLIN ARROWS\n\nRock Dams. The goblins built simple dams to control the flow of water through the heart of the complex. If the goblin sentry in area 5 has called for the goblins here to release a flood, one or both of the pools are mostly empty and the stream is flowing unimpeded.\n\n8. Klarg\u2019s Gave\n\nThe leader of the goblinoids insists on keeping the bulk of the raiders\u2019 stolen goods in his den. The Cragmaws\u2019 plunder from the last month of raiding and ambushing caravans is here."

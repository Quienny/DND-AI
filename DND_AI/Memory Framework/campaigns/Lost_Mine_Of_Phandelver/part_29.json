  "content": "King Grol is a fierce old bugbear with 45 hit points. He rules the Cragmaws through pure intimidation. Age has stooped his shoulders and hunched his back, but he remains surprisingly agile and strong. He is demanding and vindictive, and no Cragmaw dares to cross him.\n\nGrol is attended by Snarl, a wolf with 18 hit points, and a doppelganger disguised as a female drow. The doppelganger, Vyerith, is a messenger from the Black Spider, come to collect Gundren Rockseeker and the map of Wave Echo Cave from King Grol. Grol wants to sell the map instead of surrendering it, and he and the drow are negotiating a price. Vyerith first wants to question Gundren to find out if anyone else knows the location of\n\n40\n\nPART 3: THE SPIDER'S WEB\n\nthe mine. Then the doppelganger intends to kill the dwarf and destroy the map.\n\nIf the villains have been warned that an attack is imminent, Vyerith hides behind the door to the northeast, leaving it open a crack and hoping to attack an intruder from the rear. Grol holds Gundren hostage, ready to kill the dwarf if the characters don\u2019t back off.\n\nArrow Slits. The arrow slits are 15 feet above the ground outside, and the creatures here aren\u2019t keeping watch. They are unlikely to notice intruders moving around the exterior of the castle.\n\nNorthwest Room. This partially collapsed chamber was once a comfortable bathroom. It still contains a large tile tub, unused by the castle\u2019s current occupants.\n\nUnconscious Dwarf. Near the southwest corner of the room is Gundren Rockseeker, a dwarf commoner. He is unconscious but stable at 0 hit points.\n\nDevelopments\n\nIf Grol is killed, Vyerith tries to kill Gundren and flee with the map, heading toward area 11 and escaping through the concealed canvas door. If cornered, the doppelganger fights to the death rather than allow itself to be captured.\n\nIf Gundren is revived, he thanks the party for coming to his rescue but won\u2019t leave Cragmaw Castle without his map. Unfortunately, he doesn\u2019t know where King Grol has hidden it (see the \u201cTreasure\u201d section).\n\nTreasure\n\nHidden under Grol\u2019s bed mattress is a stitched leather sack containing 220 sp, 160 ep, three potions of healing, and Gundren\u2019s map to Wave Echo Cave.\n\nAwarding Experience Points\n\nDivide 950 XP equally among the characters if the party\n\ndefeats King Grol, the wolf, and the doppelganger.\n\nAward an additional 200 XP to the party if the characters rescue Gundren Rockseeker and escort him safely back to Phandalin.\n\nReturning War Band\n\nYou can add a complication in the form of a hobgoblin war band returning home, just as the characters are preparing to leave. This war band consists of three hobgoblins led by Targor Bloodsword, a hobgoblin with 20 hit points. Targor also has two wolves as pets.\n\nThe hobgoblins have no treasure, but ld4 of them carry bloody sacks, each containing a severed elf head. The severed heads are trophies from the hobgoblins\u2019 recent victory over an elf hunting party.\n\nClever characters might try to reason with Targor by urging him to think of himself as Grol\u2019s successor rather than Grol\u2019s avenger. Targor has long aspired to lead the Cragmaw tribe, so he might do the adventurers the favor of not killing them, provided one or more characters succeed on a DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check.\n\nAwarding Experience Points\n\nDivide 500 XP equally among the characters if they defeat the hobgoblin war band or come to terms with Targor.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next?\n\nIf Gundren Rockseeker survives the ordeal at Cragmaw Castle, he offers the characters his thanks and asks that they escort him back to Phandalin and then venture to Wave Echo Cave to learn the fate of his brothers, Nundro and Tharden. He knows that someone called the Black Spider orchestrated his capture and hopes that the characters stop the villain. Upon returning to Phandalin, Gundren offers the characters 25 gp each for their assistance and promises the party a 10 percent share of the mine\u2019s wealth once his operation there is up and running.\n\nWhether the characters sought the information from Agatha or Reidoth, negotiated with Hamun Kost, or recovered Gundren and his map from Cragmaw Castle, they now know the location of Wave Echo Cave. The only thing left for them to do is seek out the old dwarven delve and discover for themselves who the Black Spider is, and why he\u2019s so interested in the Lost Mine of Phandelver.\n\nPART 3: THE SPIDER\u2019S WEB\n\n41\n\nPart 4: Wave Echo Gave\n\nFifteen miles east of Phandalin, in the deep vales of the Sword Mountains, lies Wave Echo Cave. The rich mine of the Phandelver\u2019s Pact was lost five hundred years ago during ore invasions that devastated this part of the North.\n\nIn the centuries since, countless prospectors and adventurers have searched for the lost mine, but none succeeded until the Rockseeker brothers found the entrance a month ago. Unfortunately, the Rockseekers did not realize they were being trailed by spies working for Nezznar, the Black Spider, and they inadvertently led the drow villain to their prize. Nezznar and his followers dealt with the two Rockseekers who were guarding their find, then arranged for Gundren\u2019s ambush. Learning of the adventurers\u2019 involvement with Gundren or their exploits in and around Phandalin, the Black Spider has given orders for the characters to be dealt with. Meanwhile, Nezznar has begun his exploration of Wave Echo Cave.\n\nThe drow is searching for the Forge of Spells, where the human mages of old Phandalin enchanted dwarven weapons and gnome gadgets. However, Nezznar\u2019s exploration has been hindered by the restless undead and dangerous monsters that lurk in Wave Echo Cave, forcing him to proceed with great caution.\n\nThe adventurers now have the chance to aid Gundren, avenge his kin, and put a stop to the nefarious schemes of the Black Spider. And of course, the hoard of powerful magic rumored to be hidden in the mines is a rich prize.\n\nCharacter Level\n\nThis part of the adventure is designed for characters of at least 4th level and assumes that each character has earned at least 2,700 XP. If the adventurers skipped too many of the optional investigations and encounters in part 3, they might not be 4th level, and many of the encounters in this section might be difficult for them."

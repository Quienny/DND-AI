hi 🧠 Campaign JSON Converter Prompt:

I will upload a .txt file that contains the full text of a Dungeons & Dragons 5e campaign module.

Your job is to clean and convert this file into a structured set of valid .json files, optimized for SillyTavern or GPT-4o.

You will:

1. Clean the text aggressively:
   - Remove all standalone "N", "n", "nn", "nnn" that are not part of real words
   - Flatten line-wrapped text (convert single \n to space)
   - Keep paragraph breaks (double \n)
   - Normalize spacing and encoding artifacts

2. Split the text into long, natural **Parts**:
   - Use your own logic based on story flow
   - Each Part should be 5000–8000 characters minimum (no short sections)
   - Avoid blindly splitting on “Chapter” or “Part” labels

3. Output one .json file per part:
   - Each should look like this:
     
json
     {
       "part_number": 1,
       "content": "Cleaned story text here..."
     }

   - Name each file part_01.json, part_02.json, etc.

4. Create a milestones.json file with this structure:
   
json
   {
     "milestones": [
       "Level 2 → After clearing the Cragmaw Hideout.",
       "Level 3 → After defeating the Redbrands in Phandalin.",
       "Level 4 → After completing 2+ side quests (e.g., Thundertree, Wyvern Tor).",
       "Level 5 → After finishing Wave Echo Cave and defeating the Black Spider."
     ]
   }
